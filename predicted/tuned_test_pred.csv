Fit is perfect! very flattering. they are very long  so i will need to shorten.,2
Gorgeous skirt. runs a bit big.  well made. perfect for the office and super comfy.,2
I bought this dress in the red option. was a little concerned when i read other reviews that said it looked like a maternity dress  but it didn't look like that on me at all. it falls nicely and fits me well - i am 5 ft  107 lbs - in size xs. love the details at the neckline and hem. will be looking out for other dresses by maeve!,2
I purchased this sweater in my usual xs  but found the silhouette to be way more tent-like than pictured on the model. the knit is pretty stiff  too  so the sweater didn't lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape. also  the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece. i am fairly small  but lately i'm finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs. i know i'm not that tiny ... maybe this wou,1
I like this layer for fall for many reasons. first of all  the color is a beautiful fall color. the design of the vest is flattering when wore with skinny jeans or leggings. the weight of the vest is perfect for the cooler weather. it is not too heavy  it's fairly lightweight. i am a size 6 and the small fit perfectly.,2
Love the dress. runs a little big. i ordered a size down than i normally wear and it fit. versatile too--i even wore it to the office with a black blazer over it and got lots of compliments!,2
Love the versatility of this dress. looks better in person!,2
It seems this coat could have been manufactured under a smaller spec size because the size large looses shape and where it hits on the waistline is unflattering. quality is high however,1
I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however  the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.,1
"Sleepwear is always hit or miss with me. i am 5' 8"" and curvy  and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and aren't long enough. or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering. however  this pair exceeded all my expectations! first  they are just plain pretty. the pattern and colors are lovely. the blue at the ankle is a cute touch. the fabric is soft and slightly drapey - but substantial enough for warmth and not see-through at all. i also like how the waist is",2
"Love the lace cut out detail on the sleeves which is initially what attracted me to this sweater. just be careful with the threads. the sleeves are long but are supposed to be  as in the photo. comfortable material with nice weave  flattering cut. i bought the ivory color in xs for my 5'2"" 115 # straight frame. not too long",2
I love this skirt. i usually don't buy skirts of this cut because they make me look hippy. but the fabric is so lightweight and flowing  and yet it has structure. the colors are great and go with many top options. i wear it to work and casual outings. it is my favorite clothing article in my closet right now.,2
I picked this top hoping that it would go with the dipped horizon skirt and the color was a perfect match! i love the irregularities in the dye  and the woven back. the cut is boxy  but the fabric is soft and drapes well so very flattering. looks great with white jeans,2
Love this shirt. it is long enough in back to wear with leggings. it is very cute and casual on. not fitted at all. i am 5'2 and ordered a regular size so that it fits longer.,2
Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape  but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long  but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.,2
I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it  not only was it too long  but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available  i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.,0
While i wouldn't normally look at this piece  the price was unbeatable. i was even more impressed when it arrived and i tried it on! the design is reminiscent of an old time patchwork quilt fairy tale- more beautiful in person than in the pic. the covered buttons at the neck and wrists are just lovely and feminine  and the dress falls and flows around me in a fun and flirty way. i paired it with charcoal heather tights and dark gray booties- super cute! you won't regret it.,2
Super soft and comfortable with a flattering fit. love the tiny buttons and the 3/4 sleeves since many times the sleeves are too long for me. already my favorite fall top.,2
I haven't worn it yet. i tried it on when i got it and like it alot,2
"I purchased this dress while vacationing in florida and cannot wait for the midwest weather to warm up so i can wear it. i am tall (5'8"") and love how this dress fits me. i found the slip to work well with the dress and that it was not too sheer. the length was perfect  not too short in the front and just enough drape in the back. i love that the slip is attached so it lines up perfectly.",2
I had been eyeing this top for awhile and decided to get it when it went on sale. it is a very nice top. i'm going to pair it with jeans and boots for our florida fall but could see it working with a nice pair of pants. it is roomy so if you're looking for something more fitted than i would pass on this top.,2
"When i first received this sweater  i was a little worried about the bulk  especially the thick cables and popcorn stitches. after i got it on and adjusted it to all the right places  i would say it looks similar to the model in the photo. i did not find it itchy. the yarn is soft and airy but i guess it depends on how sensitive your skin is. the length was low hip on me and i'm 5'9"" tall. overall  i'm very pleased and looking forward to wearing it. can't speak to the quality of the garment beca",2
This button down is to die for! the material is incredibly soft and comfy. it looks great with my retailer leggings  and is also a great look with my casual denim  paired with a cardi and flats or booties. i've worn it several times for different looks and always get compliments on it! definitely a head-turning piece.,2
"I'm 5'9"" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i don't love green but this was so different.  would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!",2
"I love this top! i love the detail in the front and the v back. it's simple and sexy  easy to dress up or wear casually. i ordered an xs and found it to fit perfect  i'm 5'5"" and 112lbs. i ordered the olive green color which i love. i don't typically wear red so that wasn't an option for me  i do wish it came in more colors!",2
I just got this after ordering online and i was pleasantly surprised. the cardigan has the structure of a lightweight jacket  so it creates a flattering silhouette. i ordered it in a medium  and even though i'm curvy on top it fits really nicely.,2
I love this dress. the length is great and the dress just feels great. the material is raw silk (which i love) and the sizing does run a tad large  but with the make of the dress. i can lose weight and still wear the dress. well made and the buttons in back are super cute.,2
So great! soft and a great sweater but still gives you a shape to your body.,2
"These culottes are fun. i bought the neutral color with the black stripes in xs. in my opinion  they run big. i am usually a small (4-6)  31"" waist  38"" hips. pleats at the hip and low waist area are not always my friend  but with a longer tank or shirt  they looked fine. the fabric moves in a graceful way and these culottes can be dressed up or down. so far  wrinkling isn't a huge problem but we'll see. i am 5' 9"" tall and these fall about the same place on the model--mid calf. they looked grea",2
I tried this sweater on and  loved it immediately! it's super soft and comfortable  and very slimming. i tried my normal size s and an xs  and decided on the xs as the s gave it (and me!) a bit of a wider look. love the navy color!,2
"I love these pants! the pattern is polished and the flowy style is perfect for warm weather. i ordered a small and was worried they would be too short (i'm 5'10"")  but they are just right when i wear them just slightly lower than my true waist. my new favorite summer pants.",2
I was confused by this dress. the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy. it's also not lined and the material is not exactly soft. i put it back. cute  but missed the mark.,0
I decided to order this skirt to look at it and regret it now as i want to keep it. one bummer is the smallest size (xs) runs big  the skirt falls on my lower waist aka hips on me  not on my waist. bu i love the look  it has pockets where the pattern reverts the fabric is soft and thick  making the skirt structured. the length was nice on me  though ti is a mini and there is no petite size  the hem still was above my knee  and therefore was acceptably flattering. the colors are also nice for fal,2
This looked really pretty but i think i am just too short for it. a little on the wider side. would look good on someone taller,1
I'm 5'6''   athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.,1
I normally wear a size 27  but i have a pair of shorts by same designer bought several years ago in a size 26 and so i went with a size 26 for this purchase. they fit perfectly. i would have liked to order the petite  but it did not appear to be an option. the fabric is very soft and stretchy. they are little loose around the ankle  but i have very skinny calves and ankles  so that is not so surprising. the color is a perfect grey that will go with everything. i would buy these in other colors.,2
This dress looks amazing on. it fits your body like a glove and the zipper lies flat. the black out-lined neckline looks very sophisticated as does the pattern of the dress. my only issue is that the dress ran very small.,2
Love this shirt! got it in white and it will be perfect for spring! very flattering fit!,2
Goes with absolutely everything. it's very comfortable and versatile. can be dressed up or dressed down. great thing to have in the closet when you don't know what to wear!,2
I just saw this in the store and loved it! it is shorter than pictured on the model  but it's not short. with a long shirt underneath  i'll wear it with leggings. the color is beautiful!! the size does run large - i normally wear a large at retailer  and i got this in a medium. i can't wait to wear it all fall and winter long!,2
The blouse is absolutely beautiful. i am 5' and the length is perfect. even though it fit a little snug across the chest  it's a keeper. i'll wear it open on the top with a nice cami underneath.,2
I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size  however  it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump  this is a good choice. for others who are not  it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.,1
"Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress  the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven ""hump"" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality.",0
I love this dress. however  it's not what i expected based off the pictures.     the modeled photo indicates that it's a shirtdress with a drop waist. no. it's a smock dress with more of an a-line silhouette that begins at the shoulders. the waistline is more of a detail  like the button placket  than a structural quality. it's very youthful and whimsical.     that said  it is quite beautiful. the fabric does not wrinkle easily  as another reviewer guessed. my daughter wrinkled it sitting on my,2
This tunic is perfection! this tunic will be perfect with jeans or leggings and can be dressed up or be worn casual. it does run big. i am normally a medium/large in shirts and took a medium with room to spare. i probably could have worn a small too  but smalls tend to be tight on my shoulders. this is a must buy!,2
I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer  which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however  the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also  the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit  but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).,0
I love this sweater because it is an edge to it  fit is true to size and its soft and confortable,2
I just received this top and love it. the fabric is soft and comfy. it is just as pictured  no surprises. lace-up fronts are a hot item for spring. for reference  i am 5'7 and weigh #127. the xs fits perfectly.,2
I was hesitent to order this  was worried it would be too shapeless. i'm glad i ordered it as it is light and flowy though not so much that it makes you look like a shapeless tent. the colors are vibrant and the smooth fabric feels good against your skin. it is lined. i had no issues with the bust (i'm 38c). i wish it were an inch longer (i'm 5'9).,2
This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall  160lb  i usually wear size l 8/10  but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy  color is about the same as pictured  also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm  the fabric however has no stretch at all  dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves  i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe,1
"This dress is really flattering on. fits true to size. perfect length  i'm 5'6"" & dress hits just a few inches above my knees. it's simple  yet versatile seasonally. right now i plan to wear it with booties & sandals in the spring.",2
"I am 5'1"" and curvy  and purchased this dress in medium petite  and it fits to perfection! i love how light & breezy it is for those hot & muggy summer days. the tie front makes this style very flattering for all body types  and the skirt is lined so it is not see-through! plus  the pockets. this dress is a winner.",2
I purchased this in gray and it is proving to be quite versatile. it is softer than i expected and not heavy or bulky. i also like that the side slits are a bit higher than i expected. i have paired it with knit pants and with a maxi dress. i think it will work pretty much any time i need an extra layer.,2
Ordered this with my bday discount - the small felt a bit roomy so i took it to the store so i could possibly exchange for an xs. i literally could not even get my arm in the xs! tried a different small which was more fitted than the small i had received - so i would say the sizing can be inconsistent,0
I bought these for next year. ordered both 27 & 28 and kept the 27  which i would say is a pretty true 6.,2
I loved the shirt. the fabric was amazing and i loved the way it fit  unfortunately it didn't look good on me. but i would recommend this shirt to anyone who can pull it off the look  i was sad i couldn't.,1
"I bought this top in a size 6 - i'm 5'5"" with a longer torso. i thought at first that this would be too boxy and cropped but it fits very well and it still covers my stomach when i raise my arms up. the material is on the thicker side so it's a little more structured which i think gives it a nice look and drape. i feel like i could wear this shirt out on a casual day or to work with a blazer over it to dress it up more. i highly recommend it especially since the material is linen and cotton whic",2
Fun  flowy top! maybe be a little snug across the top for larger chested girls but this flares out into a light and airy dream to wear!,2
Cute bright colored suit a little more orange than pink i prefer pink but the fit didn't quite work for me      the bottoms were a little too big and the top although was fairly well proportioned just didn't look right altogether      purchase the extra smalls in both  and have since returned      i do love the suits that retailer has been offering would just love to be able to try them on in the store   nice quality good colors,2
I ordered this online  and was pleasantly surprised when i received it. i'm about 5'5 and 140 lbs and the small fit perfectly. it is very flattering  and i can't wait to wear it!,2
"Like the previous reviewer  my size 10p gaped and strained the buttons at my chest (36dd wide rib cage 5'3"" 140#). also the skirt flared out too high on my waist. i'm going to try a regular 10 with hope the torso will fit better. other than the fit on my particular body and the one distracting chest pocket  this shirt dress is very well made  very cute",2
This little number is really cute  i got it on sale  after i looked at it  went home  slept and decided i had to go ack for it:-0 i will wear it with trouser jeans and a blazer for work  or jsut jeans and boots for casual wear.,2
This is more a sweater than a sweatshirt but it also feels more casual  like a sweatshirt. i put it on and immediately felt comfortable. it's stylish but not frumpy and it will work for me running around town doing errands or going out for a casual lunch or dinner. it's a perfect weight sweater to throw on in the cool cali evenings.,2
This print is so cool! the shirt is just a little loose so order your usual size and it will fit perfectly.,2
A swing top by tiny done right. this is a well made top that fits in all the right places  no gapping arm pit! the fabric has a design in it and i think this is a blouse that can be worn all year. the blouse does run large and depending on the chest size  you may have to go down two sizes. i went for the large at first just because swing tops are so short but realized i would need a medium and the length was still perfect. it did not flare out to where you looked like an expectant mother.,2
Material is gorgeous and soft but the fit is another story. i am a size 12/14 but very small busted. this suit is definitely meant for someone with a larger chest. the padding was so overwhelming. i also have a long torso so it just didn't really line up were the peplum should be. too bad. it's very pretty. but looked horrible.,0
"Saw this in the store and immediately liked it. when i tried it on  i loved it. colors are muted  and the style is very flattering. the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy  which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south. length is perfect for me (5'8""). it does look great off the shoulders  but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more work-appropriate look. it does run slightly large. i wear a large  but went with a medium in this one so it wouldn't be to",2
I have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans. sadly i don't think these are it. i love the design and style of these jeans. great length  great cut  great color unfortunately in the 3 weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like i've had them for 3 years. i'm so disappointed. and will have to continue on my search. apparently they don't make jeans like they used too?,1
I love this skirt! as a fan of different textures and pretty things  this piece exceeded my expectations! i am always a size 0 or 2 in retailer dresses and the 2 fits like a glove. the length is perfect - just above the knee. ever since i wore a valentino dress with a similar thick  neoprene material  i've adored the feel of it! everything feels firm and put together. the colors in this skirt are beautiful and the pattern is feminine and romantic. it will pair well with lots of different tops too!,2
I really love this top; i got the ivory and now i will probably get the black too. if you get it in your normal size (i'm almost always an xs and got this in xs)  it's fitted and flattering. the seam across the sternum makes it feel like an empire top which always seems to look good on me. it is fitting in the chest and arms. it's really lightweight and has 1/2 sleeves so i will wear this even in summer.,2
The fabric of this top is a tee shirt  mid weight material. it has a nice drape and the color variations along the vee are true to the photo. i purchased size large and it's a bit wide and long for my frame. you could safely size down. the fabric drapes nicely but i didn't like the sleeves or length and it fits large so am returning.,2
Beautiful just like the photo. i love it. the length is fine  as i got the l. the quality is very good.,2
Ordered online  hedging my bets on size (chose xs/s) because i have broad shoulders and muscular arms and wear anything from 2-8 sizes depending on brand. my gamble paid off - it&#39;s a beautiful sweater. soft  comfortable  nice drape.    (i suspect that finer-boned more petite customers might complain of swimming in this  but it worked well for me!),2
I love these. the color and the style. but they are once again too short. they are not 33 inches. i need 32 inches to go to the floor. these are above the floor so they are not 33 inches. very disappointing.,1
These cords are a great  skinny fit.  they seem true to size for me and look great on.  only issue i would have is the color says navy  but they are more of a deep purple-ish color.  i had to recheck my order because they definitely aren't navy....but i'm keeping them because the fit is awesome.,2
Unfortunately  this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big  too shapeless.,0
There were only 2 pairs left in my store and they had my size! they are super comfortable and easy to wear with anything on top because of the navy embroidery being such a classic color. i would definitely recommend. i may buy the floral embroidery ones too.,2
Beautiful summer top and so versatile! it's definitely worth it.,2
I wear a 25/26 jean and the size s in this bikini bottom was just too small. in photos it looks so cute  but on me it just didn't look like anything special. hopefully the larger size has more pizzazz.,2
"It's navy and red--the photo looked black to me. so i couldn't use with black skirt that i had planned to pair it with  but it's cute with jeans and maybe white shorts next summer. the front gapes open when you sit down  so i'll either have to pin it or sew a snap there unless i want the world to see my bra. also a little short waited for me--i'm 5""11""  so i wish the wrap hit a little lower  but not enough that i didn't keep it. it is flattering blouse. the shoulder ties add a little extra flair",2
I can't wait for the first signs of fall so i can wear this! the fabric is a nice light weight and the fit is very flattering. as another interviewer commented  it can also be worn as a dress. well worth the investment!!,2
I've worn this twice now and got a ton of compliments on it. it's so comfortable and looks great. the lavender color is gorgeous. highly recommend.,2
When i saw this sweater online i honestly didn't think it was really anything special. however  when i saw it in my local retailer store i really liked the knit as well as the color (kind of an off white/ pinkish) i decided to give it a try. i have to say that i really like this sweater a lot. the cut is quite flattering even though it is baggy and it is very soft. i think it will look very cute with a pair of skinny jeans and boots this winter. glad i decided to give it a try.,2
Really like the loose flowiness. runs big went from med to small with better results. style is forgiving,2
"When i saw this jacket in store  i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3"" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc",1
"This jacket has a nautical look which is a refreshing change for this year. it is double breasted & a stretchy cotton  which i love. i am a big fan of cotton. it appealed to me so much that i ordered both the white & the navy in the regular size small. i am of small build at 5'3""  117# & expected that the sleeves c/b a little long. i avoid ordering petite size jackets b/c sometimes they are snug in the shoulders. ok  so the regular s was a good length at the bottom of my hips  but arms were bagg",2
I love this sweater. my only worry is that i'll constantly be catching the little loops on things and getting it all messed up. i haven't been able to wear it out yet  so we'll see! i'll just have to be careful :),2
I bought the dress in mango. i love the color. it is very vibrant. the fit is great and i imagine getting a lot of use out of this dress during the summer months. my only complaint is that i expected the fabric to be a little bit heavier. i find it to be kind of thin.,2
Light weight jacket  perfect layering piece . short enough to be the right accessory over a dress or skirt without getting a sloppy look. versatile  - also great over a long tee with skinny jeans. well made  fold cuffs back for the classic look.,2
I absolutely adore these shorts and pick a few colors every year. like last year  these do run big so do size down. the length is perfect to roll them as much as you like. they look great after washing and wish they came in more brighter colors. love these and highly recommend these!,2
"I liked this dress  but had some issues. i am 5' 3"" and a 34 d. with small shoulders. the dress was way too big in the shoulders in the 6 i usually wear  so just hung on me funny. otherwise i really liked it. if it weren't for the way it fit me on top (not an unusual problem if you are large busted but have small shoulders) meant i had to return it.",2
Layered this with a chunky sweater and a pair of kicks. it can be low key or dressed up with a pair of heels  multi-functionality not just occasional. it&#39;s feminine  funky  and fabulous!! i bought the last one in the store!,2
"I've never spent this much on a pair of jeans  but per another customer review that they were ""worth every penny"" i took the plunge. so glad i did. and also glad i sized down one size. be careful when you put them on - i keep putting my toe through the hole at the knee!",2
It is so cute in the picture but wasn't flattering on me. it also felt like i couldn't raise my arms while wearing it. i love retailer and will be a forever fan  but this dress just wasn't for me.,0
"Yes  like the photo suggests  this piece has a lot of the features of a jacket. but  i bought it to also wear as a dress. let me explain...    fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  high waist  dress/top size 10 (without buttons  etc.) or 12 (fitted at the bust and waist)  bottom size 6 (upside down triangle)  5'2""    i bought the small in this piece  because it is big enough to wear as a light jacket while also being fitted enough to wear as a dress. on the inside of the piece  there are strings that",2
These are the most comfortable trousers in my whole wardrobe.  love them.,2
Saw this online when it first came up and thought it looked lovely. i purchased a different pleated dress and decided i didn't need a second pleated dress. was at my local retailer and they had one pink dress in a size 4 and a blue in a 0. decided to try them both on. the zero actually fit perfectly and at the sale price i had to have it. the material is beautiful  little details like the ruffled hem are lovely. one i will wear for years. thinking about getting the link but the blue is lovely. i'm,2
This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model. the pattern and texture are both lovely  and the peplum is surprisingly flattering. it is definitely on the short side  but i think that gives it a modern look. the fabric does not stretch at all  but i still think it fits tts. if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size  but otherwise i would order your normal size.,2
"I have been looking at this top online & today i tried it on in the store in a size small and xs regular. i am 5'3""  120 lbs. 34b  and the xs fit better than small. in the small the armholes were too low & showed my bra. this is the regular cut  not even petite (& note i am on the shorter side) & the length was a few inches shorter than i would like. glad i didn't order this online in petite. i love the detail & the material looks wellmade  with the exception of the beading in one spot was alrea",2
I saw these in my local retailer and loved them on the hanger. when i tried them on  not so much. the material is a pretty substantial white denim and very stretchy (i didn't find them to be that smooth of a fabric  but more of a traditional denim texture). i am a 6-8 in pants  and normally wear a 27 in pilcro denim. when i tried on the size 27 in the store  i found them to be very tight in the thighs - and i don't have big thighs. i also found the pants to pull conspicuously across the crotch are,2
Pretty and unique. great with jeans or i have worn it to work with slacks and heels. the colors  print  and embroidery are lovely. reasonably priced!,2
I love this dress! it is equally pretty in person too. sometimes i will order things and when i get them the colors are totally different than what i anticipated. not with this dress. i love it and will get a lot of use out of it over the spring/summer.,2
I really love this dress. i cannot believe how many people have complimented me on this dress and ask where i bought it. the color is so soft and pretty. the dress is comfortable as well. it looks great with a light pair of wedges.,2
Lovely cut  pretty creamy color  great top for strong shoulders  however. the upper section of this top is way more sheer than it appears in the photos. there is no bra that would really work with it--unless you want to embrace the undergarment visibility and go with one that has really pretty straps. just be sure the bra fits especially well  because any back fat will absolutely show. if you go without a bra  though: headlights. so there's that.,1
First time trying pilcro  but glad i did. these shorts are extremely soft and comfortable without being too short. love love!,2
I loved the style so i ordered on line. it runs small and the arm inserts are so low its awkward to wear. i wish the cut was better cause i love the look but not the fit. i am returning this item..,1
I normally am a xl or size 18 in fabric tops (if they're not knit and do not stretch.) but  this looked to be a bit boxy and so i bought the 16 and it fit fine. it fit like on the model....tailored  but loose and not really a lot of fabric or boxy.    now  the fabric is stiff. and  it's sheer. but  the pockets land where your breasts are. so  i wore this with a nude bra and it's just like in the photo. there are peeks but you don't see anything. however  if this is for work  i'd put a cami under,1
Very comfortable and versatile. got lots of compliments.,2
I was so excited to order this dress  had the perfect red shoes to go with it. unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small. i am 5'4/118lb and it was like a maternity dress. sad to send it back.,0
This dress is a lovely fit. the knit top accentuates the bust and the loose skirt below the empire waist just skims the figure. it's pretty casual and the skirt is a tiny bit sheer so better for weekends than for office wear.,2
I absolutely love this dress. i'm always leery about buying lace and white  but i love this off-white color and style. i was able to stretch the sleeves a tad to make them more fluttery  but they aren't as fluttery as the photo looks. definitely more of a cap sleeve. got so many compliments!,2
"I bought this dress online and have to say the material is really soft  has a great weight to it  and i bought it in the red motif. i just wore it to work this past week and received a ton of compliments on it. i wore it with black nylons black heels  and a cropped leather jacket. it is so figure flattering and so comfortable to wear. i typically range in size from an xs to a s  and the s fit me the best. i'm 5'9"" and 130 lb. it is truly a lovely dress!",2
"I totally agree with the last reviewer. i'm 5'2"" 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders. the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn't move my arms. the small was better but was too big in the torso. the material itself was really nice. too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering.",1
These jeans have become my new favorite pair! i bought two pairs during the clearance sale and wear them often. i love the metallic accents near the front pockets and the dark wash can be dressed up or down.,2
I like this top. it is a nice casual top. i think it looks better on the model because it looks a bit dressy. when i tried it on  it looked good but not as dressy. the embroidery on the side gives the top a nice look. i also like the tie-dye look. the price is high  i got it on sale price. the fabric is a simple t-shirt  the embroidery makes it stand out. i am keeping it.,2
I tried this on in the store to see if it would be my go to party top and splurge this season. i love the colors  textures  and embellishments. so lovely! ultimately the price and the very flowy fit (particularly in the back) made me put it back. another great item from moulinette soeurs  though!,2
A really great basic that can be styled a number of ways. i bought it in tan and white and received many compliments on it. the slightly off the shoulder look is really flattering and perfect for a spring or summer look.,2
"I love the colors  my favorite. purchased a medium and fits perfectly. i've been wearing it all summer. material is thin but super soft. for reference i am 5'8"" 145 lbs 32dd. i'm obsessed with this tank. considering buying a second just in case anything happens to the one i have  that's how much i love this tank.",2
Love this top. it is a little big through the body/waist  i thought it would be a little more fitted but i still love it. the bow really makes the shirt,2
When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress  the stripes are diagonal. however  that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas  not very flattering  so back it goes.,0
Absolutely gorgeous! i bought my regular size m and while it's a little wide in the shoulders  it drapes beautifully. because i'm so short  i found the sleeves too long so i took it to my dressmaker and she shortened the sleeves about two inches so it's still elbow length and while i was there  she put in two small darts in the back so make it less boxy for my frame. can't wait to wear it - it's a beautiful material and i love the combo of the metallic sheen and velvet. so elegant. very gatsby ,2
In theory  this dress was perfect for me. the colors  the embroidery  the sheer top and keyhole back... so romantic! sigh. something about the fit just kept it from being a wow moment. i'm usually 10-12  the 12 was way too big  the 10 more fitted  but still it wasn't quite right. the sheer part dips quite low  and sizing down helped  but it could still be a lil dangerous. i kept feeling like it wasn't defining my waist enough and wanted a tighter waist and more full skirt. maybe i would have fel,2
"Runs really large. i am 5'4""  120lbs  32c  and had to exchange xs for xxs for width  but then the sleeves were a little tight. decided to keep the xxs in white.",2
I love the design and the fabric  but the fit is just off on this dress. the area around the bust is just not fitted well. the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat. that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress  but the waist also sat too high on me (maybe i'm long waisted  who knows?)  so between the super high waist and the flannel-type fabric  it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me. i wish it weren't so. i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou,1
So this is a great tee  problem is the white you can see through. i an not looking for a layering tee so not what i was looking for.,1
Love pilcro  love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you  however!,1
This shirt is semi-fitted. i like it because it is not boxy but not overly tight. it is not heavy even though it is a sweatshirt material. i wish the neck was a bit higher but i will wear a tee under it. the back is really cute.   it is different and i like that.,2
Very cute summer dress. it runs a bit large and it doesn't give you shape. but  it's good for me to hide my belly fat. the dress is so comfortable to wear. i didn't know that it has pockets  so that was a pleasant surprise (i always love pockets). overall  it's a perfect summer dress.,2
Fit great. hang nice. extra loop to hold belt. perfect design.,2
Love this top  you can really fess up  i ordered in a small i am 5 7 and 154 pounds,2
"This dress is so much better in person! i got the petite size (i am 5'2"") and it seems to run a bit smaller than the regular size- i have a fairly large bust so i went up a size and it seems to fit perfectly. love the colors and vintage design! i can't wait to wear it for a wedding i will be attending!",2
I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money  for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style.,0
I really loved this skirt on the model  but it just wasn't flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5'4  athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to.     sadly  i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame.,1
I love flowers! i love flowers on my basic tees even better! simple comfy but different from your every day plain old tee!,2
I ordered this in yellow after the size small in store didn't fit. it's such a cute summer top  perfect with cropped jeans! i'm a 32b and usually a size small but had to size down. i could still see the top of my strapless bra in the front so i wear a lacy bandeau with it and it's super cute. because of this though  i wouldn't pay full price so i'm happy it was on sale!,2
This is a great casual skirt  i ordered the 0p or xs petite and it fit perfectly. both colors are nice  i don't think i could choose though i do have a taupe skirt  so leaning towards the slate color. the fit is also flattering  waist is snug  but not tight. the fabric is soft  could wear in the fall or even winter with tights. i recommend... (115 lbs  26.5 in waist),2
I love  love  love this absolutely stunning dress. the only problem was that the zipper was very difficult to maneuver  and when it finally went up  the watch it was attached the lining of the dress made a bump in the dress  which was very unflattering on an otherwise very flattering dress. i tried on multiple versions of this dress and had the same design issue with each. i ended up returning it because it bothered me so much.,1
These run small. i normally wear 28 on ag stevie's and paige jeans so i ordered these in 28 and they were very tight. otherwise very well made and super cute but i had to return them.,1
I bought this dress for my bridal shower and it is perfect. the pattern is beautiful and very similar to the image shown online. the fabric is much lighter than i anticipated which is nice for spring/summer weather. i had to get the top altered slightly to better fit on top but it was a very easy alteration. i am normally a size 8 in dresses and found this to fit very true to size.,2
Bummer  i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.,0
I had my eye on the skier blouse for awhile before i gave in to the purchase. love it for fit and graphics - those happy little skiers! i think many reviewers here don't realize this blouse has the cut of a swing style. it's not meant to be tailored for tucking in. if you want to tuck it you'll be wearing a high-waisted skirt or pant  cute also ;-) rayon fabric is a good choice for the style being heavier than cotton and having a better drape over the chest. the sloping longer hemline toward the,2
I ordered this coat because  like others  i was taken by its feminine beauty! unfortunately  the coat showed up with the top button broken off (and missing) and another button hole torn open. i returned that coat right away  thinking that it'd been damaged somehow in shipping. however  i began to question the quality of the coat when the second coat showed up with a broken and missing top button! when i tried on the coat  i found the missing button stuffed into the pocket. not the quality i expe,0
I wanted to love this dress..and it did not disappoint! true to size  not too snug but doesn't make you look shapeless. the material is soft and has great movement. looks great with boots and booties. i know i will be wearing this one often!,2
This dress is gorgeous! the color is perfect for spring/summer. the dress does run wide/loose. i read reviews before ordering and i am glad that i did. i am usually a petite size  but the reviews recommended going with the regular due to length and the design at the bottom (and wanting to be able to bend over comfortably). i am 5'2 and about 116lbs. i ordered the 2 regular and it worked well. i received many compliments!,2
This is a beautiful piece--and a really great deal on sale. it is sheer  but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit!,2
This dress ran large on me. i am a 10  sometimes an 8 but went with the 10. it just hung on me  giving me no shape. the colors are pretty and the dress was nice  but i expected it to wow me more for the price. sending back  may try again if the next size makes it to sale.,1
I am tall and this sweater is a great length. very flattering  slightly loose across the tummy. i have the red/mauve color and may order the gray too. super soft   medium weight sweater- very versatile. love,2
I'm 5'0 125 lbs and the petite small fits perfectly. i love the length of the shorts  not too short and not frumpy either. the waist has a hidden band so it hugs you in a good way and makes the top half slightly blousy  so it's forgiving. will go great with gray booties  black wedges or sandals.,2
"I have been stalking these pants since they first showed up on retailer's site. i have never even tried on anything like this before though  so have been waiting patiently for a review to get an idea of what they might look like  fit like...etc sale plus 30% off was incentive to take the plunge without a review though. i am wearing them right now and they are so comfortable and pretty and just...everything summer. perfect!!!! i am not a ""shorts"" person  generally wear skirts and dresses. these are",2
"I saw this in the store and fell in love with it! i normally wear between a 29 and 30 in pants and the medium fit great. it is a very generous cut in the leg and the waist has an elastic band in the back. i'm 5'5"" and the pants almost graze the top of my foot  perfect for sandals. if i had seen this stock photo first i would have been totally off-put by the culotte length  but i guess that's what it looks like on a model! there are cute buttons that run down the outside length of the pants and t",2
Stylish. great color. great fir in between weather.  may need shortening but constructed in a way that will make it easy.,2
Great for the beachy business look. classy  but immensely comfortable. i feel like i look sharp without having to sit poker-straight.,2
I could seriously sleep in this--it's that soft! i dressed this with a white tee and holey jeans then i wore it to work today over a blue midi dress. love this jacket!!!,2
I do a lot of online shopping and  consequently  a lot of returning. when i saw this shirt online i was really excited about it - it just looks very elegant  nice and airy. when the shirt arrived  i almost thought that i should return it  because there was blue lint all over the body and sleeves. turns out that this is part of the shirt; if you zoom in  you can see the blue specs woven in. i didn't end up returning the shirt  because it's extremely comfortable  and i still get a lot of complimen,2
The material and color of the dress were great  but the fit was rather blah. i don't think it was right for my shape. i am disappointed though  i liked design of it.,1
Love the wear of these jeans but they run small! designed holes have grown much larger-i don't dryer dry them.,1
When i put this skirt on my aunt said that looks like a skirt with class. she's right. this skirt feels as wonderful on as it looks. i love the faux leather slash  it is the perfect detail without detracting from a printed top. i think it is great to just slip on no zipper (for those days).i even pulled this on over a dress. bailey 44 hits it out of the park again. i have 3 dresses and now a skirt. t.e colors on the website are brighter than they are in person  just fyi.,2
Off the shoulder is everywhere and this is a great shirt for the fall.,2
I tried this one with the free ship/20% without much expectation so i was surprised by this nice piece. i am not usually a fan of sheer shirts  but this one manages to be sheer yet not see through! the black color works that magic. the linen makes this a nicer material rather than the usual knit. i am not usually a linen fan as it gives me the itches  but this is soft and light. the back is really beautiful and brighter colors in person. the balance between the front and back lengths does work a,2
"I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this ""coat"" looks great in the pictures  but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined  so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin  unlined jacket  why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse  the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)",0
I'm not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didn't consider gravity but this is not what i expected. i really want to like this top  but i don't see how i can wear it.,1
This is my first maxi skirt and i am pleasantly surprised! i might not have purchased this had i not tried it on in store  but did for the fun of it and loved the shape and swing of the skirt. the material is a comfortable and substantial stretchy jersey fabric with an inner lining that keeps it from being sheer. though it is kind of a dark navy  i would agree with one of the previous reviewers that it could pass for a black and white pattern. for my sister's graduation  i paired it with a white,2
I'm too tall for this. back goes halfway up my back. cannot do much with it other than front tie. fabric is not soft at all. not impressed. returned it.,0
"I tried this in a size medium. i have purchased several rompers this summer and that's usually the size that fits (i'm 5'4"" and hover around 130lbs). i'm short waisted. i don't have a long torso but this just fit. if you look at the model in the pic  she's bent to one side giving the look of blousing at the top  but if you stand upright  it's very straight and smooth. i could get it to blouse over the waist but then i had to pull the bottom up so high the shorts became way to short. i like the m",2
"This top is beautiful  the lace is sturdy and intricate and the top drapes perfectly  slimming. but  a word to the wise  the lace does not stretch at all even though the rest of the material does and that coupled with where it is on the bust and back means very limited movement unless you are a size 0 with an narrow back/chest and shoulders. i can't imagine anyone with a cup size larger than a b wearing this. i am 5'5""  145 lbs and a 34b and always a small or medium and a size 6 for reference. i",2
"This is the best little romper i have ever tried on. i don't typically love myself in shorts but these are so flowing and the pattern is so pretty i couldn't resist. the material is nice and the length is great. i'm 5'6"" and 135lbs and the small fit great.",2
Lovely material and the white is like a milky white which i love. it hangs beautifully  irons well and fits great. i am 5'-6  an a cup  150 lbs and ordered the small. i've already received a lot of compliments on it.,2
This dress is very cute. the material is high quality and as others have mentioned it isn't jet black  but more muted. the cut of the neckline is very flattering and the pockets are definitely a bonus. you could dress this up or down with flats or heels - it's very versatile. it will be perfect for summer and in the evening you can throw a sweater or even a moto jacket over it. definitely worth every penny.,2
Got this in wine  very pretty and soft. but so sheer  even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami. returning for this reason. having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra-comfort.,1
This is the little black dress i've been looking for for years -- great slim fit (runs small -- i usually get sized out but the 00 was a snug fit)  eye-catching design. like the other reviewer  i think solid black panels rather than floral brocade would have been classier  but overall a chic dress.,2
This dress was exactly what i was looking for- a rich  luxurious fabric  a deep neckline  and a tightly cinched waist. i have a full bust and  while the snug waistband was a negative for some reviewers  for me it is a little miracle. this dress fit like a glove and was flattering in my usual size. thank you!,2
I get a ton of compliments on this. cute and comfortable. you can't go wrong.,2
I got the burgundy color and i do have to say that the color looks a little better online than it does in person  but it's not too much of a difference. this is a really cute thong  and if you're just trying to be sexy/romantic  then i think it would be fine and there's nothing at all wrong with it. however  i like to wear thongs just in general because i think they're comfortable and i like not having to worry about panty lines  and this is definitely not the most comfortable. the front pattern,2
"I love these jeans so much i have 4 pairs. i bought pink and gray last year and then black and denim this year. i am 5'4"" 112 lbs. with a slim  straight  athletic build. these jeans look amazing on; they don't have those funny crease rolls in the legs because the legs weren't cut right  i don't have to tug on the waist to get them to stay up and they are just very flattering on. sometimes when i try on skinny jeans  they fit funny around the waistband and make my hips look weird. not these  i ju",2
I wanted to like this so much. it's a great good girl dress  church dress. however  it makes no sense. it's a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags i'm petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide.,0
"I love these pants. i vary between 10 & 12  the 10 fit perfectly since they are designed on the fuller size  perfect for my body type of small waist and a bit of bottom. so many colors to coordinate with these pants. teal green  ""retailer"" yellow  black...i am not fond of ankle pants  prefer longer pants. i took the cuffs down and lengthened the pants. the only problem is that these pants are so exquisitely made  removing the cuff tacks was a challenge! perfect pants for those of us who have shape",2
Just got these and they are great..i ordered mine online and took the advice of many reviewers to size down. i usually wear a 27 (sometimes a 26) but got these in a 26 and they are perfect. the material is soft and stretchy. would highly recommend these to all.,2
This shirt is comfortable and looks just like the picture. my only complaint is that it is quite boxy so not very flattering. the colors and details are great. the material is good quality and thick. if you are looking for a light t-shirt this is not for you,2
This top is super cute and colorful. admittedly  i have not used it just as a pajama top because i think the world deserves to see this piece of art. super comfy and i recommend this for everyone in most shapes and sizes!,2
Very comfortable shirt.  washes up nicely with just a little ironing on the pleats.  cute detail of colored thread on buttons.  just a tad tight in the shoulders but not distracting.  no button placket chest gapping.,2
"I was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on. it's a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe it's because i ordered a large? i'm 5'8""  180lbs  36d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge! not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress!",0
I tried this on when i saw it hanging in the dressing room. i was pleasantly surprised by this piece. the color is beautiful - not too yellow - not too brown. i have not worn it yet so i'm assuming it will hold up pretty well considering my other pieces from this designer are still looking good with several wears. i bought this in a small size so it does not hang down like it does on the model. perhaps that's why i don't need a cami underneath.,2
The fit is a little bit odd  it is short and wide  too much fabric. the quality is not good  the buttons can easily break and the stitching was falling apart. i am returning it.,1
This dress is the opitome of summer! day or night  running errands during the day to a casual night out this dress will be that go to favorite. i feel it runs small on the top  i am large busted and i sized up for this reason and it still could be roomier...i wear a size 10 on top and for referance i got the 12. i will keep it as it is not uncomfortable but for a drees that lends to a drape on top i wish they would have made it roomier....imhave never had this issue with mauve as it is one of my,2
I had been eyeing these for a while  but as they didn't seem very popular  i figured i'd wait for a sale. i finally bought them at the 40% off of sale price (yay!) and i love them. they're extremely comfortable  and very flattering. i'd say they run true to size  but maybe on the smaller end of the size for the waist. the blue pants are more greenish in color than the picture shows  but still beautiful. i'm looking forward to wearing these now and into the spring.,2
"I purchased this dress in ""yellow"" in a size 8 and 10 since i'm between sizes  and the 8 fits like a dream. i love this dress. it's a nice length  hitting just below my knees  and i can pull off strappy sandals as well as wedge heels and it all looks great. i also like that the top is situated so that i can wear a regular bra with it. i was concerned that the pleats would look tacky in person  but they give the dress a nice amount of movement and swing. highly recommend!",2
I was so excited when i ordered this  i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it  there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something  i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it  not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am 'stuck'!!,0
I purchased this jacket in the beige color from the black friday sale and have already worn it several times. it is comfortable  warm. and stylish. i love it so much i got it as christmas gift for a good friend and my sister. as for sizing  i do find saturday/sunday brand runs a little big. i typically wear medium or size 8 in tops and bought the jacket in a size small.,2
"I love the details and design of this top- my only issue is the top is a bit too ""flowy"".",2
Comfy  gauzy tee that has lovely lace detailing. the white is totally see through just fyi. i don't think it's the best quality but totally worth the sale price. i got the m and it's loose and flowy in a good way.,2
Note to photographers: please don't cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isn't. this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed. i'm petite  way too much fabric. returned.,0
This flared skirt caught my attention the first time it came up in the website.  i am more a florals and lace kind of girl but the flattering shape and stripes kept me going back to it agin and again.  i finally saw it in person at my store and needed to try it on.  perfect! the colors are matte and not metallic as i thought based on the website photo.  you can definitely dress it down with a chambray too or t shirt.  i wore it to a work meeting and can't wait to wear it again.  it's a bit on th,2
Thought i would try this as other reviewers loved it and it's out of my comfort zone. it looked like a poncho with a baggy tank underneath. not worth the price. the tassels looked a bit worn as well.,0
This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise  it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.    this one is going back.,0
I absolutely love the look of this shirt with the built in layering piece. the overall garment is lightweight and not too heavy even with the added layer. however; this runs really large. in general  this brand runs large for me and i would say that if you are used to this brand  you can stick with your normal sizing for this brand. however; compared to other brands it runs very large. i think it would work fantastic for me in a different size. it is not at all fitting so it would be more like a,2
I bought a few of these tops in the long sleeved version during the fall/winter  so i was super excited to see the short sleeved version come out! in this brand  i can wear an xs or s - i typically wear a s in retailer tops. if you need a tee that covers your lady parts when wearing leggings  this is it! it perfectly covers my rump and looks great. it's a nice weight  too. the detailing down the back is a nice touch.,2
I wanted to love these  but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind. the fabric is so soft  however and the color is great. would work on a less curvy woman!,1
I usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly. this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didn't. i'm 5'4 and i ordered a petite small. i was swimming in it. the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants. i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me.,1
The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.,2
Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so  back it goes. and  i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top!,0
"Super soft comfy underwear. i sized up and they fit perfectly. normally wear xs and bought m for most comfortable fit. they don't ride up. i ended up ordering 5 more pairs. super comfy without being too ""mom"" like.",2
This dress is so pretty!! the second i saw it i knew i had to have it. make sure to get a smaller size because it can be a little big towards the waist as a result of the dress' design.,2
This sweater is a must have for fall!! super comfy yet stylish fit make it fun to dress up or down. i plan on wearing it with leggings and high boots!,2
I'm usually an xs for most retailer dresses and shirts. i ordered up per other reviews and got a small. the small fits comfortably around my waist. the chest area is not made for large chests. my 34ds were barely contained. sad to say  i won't be keeping the dress. the layers  fabric  and colors are truly pretty but the design/fit is disappointing.,0
Have only tried on but it is a very cute skirt and i think will be comfortable to wear. i love the texture of the material. i do wish it came in other colors. it is a little heavier material but not too much.,2
This is my kind of clothing item. i love linen  stripes  pockets and a loose look in an over piece. it has the lining to give a good hang to the coat. linen may not be for all but i do like the look of the fabric. i feel this is true to size giving you the loose look and not a slim fit. the sleeve length is just perfect for this look and finishes the overall style. it does not have any neck closure which may bother some. i have never purchased from this maker so took a chance in quality but am p,2
I loved this dress when i saw it in the store. the colors  weight  fabric. love. love. love.   unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers  the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite  which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end  i had to pass.,1
Yep. this is snug  so maybe you might consider upping your normal size. but here's the annoying thing for me...the buttons fell off. not kidding. the first i wore this blouse and two buttons came off. when i looked at the other ones i saw that they all needed to be resewn to keep them attached. what a bother. but i'm doing it because the cotton poplin is nice and the little ruffle is a nice touch that i really like . where am i going to find another? so i'll fix it up the way it should have been,1
Better than a regular boring cardigan. goes with short sleeves and dresses!!,2
I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with. my recent preference has been for high-rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash. when i tried these on in my normal size  they were so cute that i bought them full-priced. i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy (which is what makes them soft and comfortable)  but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours. by th,2
I had such high hopes for this top. it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable! the lace/beadwork is extremely itchy. the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off. the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me.,1
"I like design of the dress  softness and color ( i got grey)  the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5'6"" 145 lbs) i got m fits ok but i don't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time. despite i got it with 40% discount it will come back as it's poor quality.",1
Unfortunately this was too low cut for me so i had to return it. i wish the neckline was higher. i could tug it up but it slipped right back down. the fabric is a perfect spring weight and the floral pattern is lovely. on me the ties  no matter how i fiddled  didn't cover the cleavage issue and i am a aa!,2
Love this shirt! i have it in both colors. you can wear it off the shoulder or on. it's baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans  i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough  you couldn't see i had drains underneath my tank top. i am really grateful for this shirt! super soft  super cute!,2
First off  these are great because they are not so tight like all other work out crops that my anatomy is not a mystery to people around me. i have an athletic build and these pants are awesome in that they hug the body lightly. they are so soft and comfy also. perfect for running and the gym and apres whatever. i bought a back up pair.,2
"You can't tell by the photo but the top is actually a slightly shiny material...so it gives it a classy  going out look. in the picture it looks more casual  but i can see myself wearing this on a night out with a skirt  wearing it to work  or whatever. i tried it on and i thought ""wow  i look thin."" it's a little shorter than i normally wear (don't worry  it's not a crop top  but notice where the bottom hem sits on the models hips  probably mid-rise)  but it looked amazing on. zippers in the ba",2
"First  i received mine with the back button (by the neck) busted (the part where you insert the button was loose  so could not button).   i ordered the yellow one  and was surprised how yellow it was when received. it is brighter than the picture shows  not bad though.  the cut of the dress is nice  very ""sweet""  i liked that it was flowy and the lace was beautiful to me. arms were a tad tight  only because i have muscular arms. stil lable to wear it.    i ordered the 0petite  and it fit. i am 1",2
Love this dress  i've already worn it many times. i started off with a small but had to go to xs which is smaller than my normal size in order to get the fit as pictured. the length is great and works with tights or boots.  great unique dress!,2
I love wearing this dress and have had many compliments. it's a great color and a fabulous fit,2
This shirt is so comfortable! the fabric is amazingly soft and it is very well made. i liked the top so well that i bought one in grey and one in blue  and both in different sizes so that the smaller (xs) is a little closer fitting and the larger (s) is more blouse and casual. i had originally purchased both in m (which also looked fine  just larger and even more roomy)  but exchanged for the smaller sizes. this is a wonderful casual weekend top to pair with skinny jeans  flats  leather boots  o,2
The back of this top is nice but it is very flowy. i ordered a small (32dd  normally a 4/6 in retailer tops) -- a smaller size would fit better but is not available. overall nice  but wish it came in a smaller size.,1
It's the print that attracted me when i was in the store. it is beautiful  but i fear it demands darker skin and hair. if you have problems with yellow  then don't buy. i don't mind the transparency of the fabric because it is not noticeable if you wear a flesh colored cami underneath. because the fabric is light and the shape boxy  it is meant to be flowing  so i purchased my regular size. if you have small breasts you would probably prefer a smaller size. i only wish the blouse had been a litt,2
"I ordered this in the white in my usual size 26  and these were too big on me (5'5""  110lbs). the pants bunched up unattractively around my thighs because they were not form-fitting. i am hoping to exchange for the size 25 because i prefer a tighter fit. the style of the pants were very cute. i like the side slit detail and the cropped look. i'm hoping these pants work out for me in the smaller size.",2
I bought this dress for its green color and flowy design to wear at an irish fest held in the hot summer. it's perfect! being of irish descent with red hair and fair skin  i love all shades of green  and this green dress is no exception. the color is lovely and eye-catching and cool. as to the sizing  i usually wear a size 8  but to make sure due to the design  i ordered an 8 and a 6. there wasn't a great difference between the two dresses  but the size 6 top was a bit more fitted and looked bet,2
Okay  so this top has its redeeming qualities  i promise! which is why i gave it 3 stars when i really wanted to give it two. but it's just not worth 2 because i'm sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable. for people who purchase this  it will last forever. it's sturdy cotton  not thin like many retailer tee materials. the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice. it's a great looking top. my issue though  wasn't with the bust as other reviewers hav,2
This blouse is just so beautiful! but i do love white blouses  so that may influence my enthusiasm. however  once i buttoned it up  it was just dreamy. i have a long torso and am tall for a typical xs  so it's often hard to find something that's the right length. this is perfect! it may overwhelm some ladies who are on the petite side of height  but it's a rare find for me. paired with a pair of cropped pants because i'd come in a dress  it looks delightfully vintage in the best of ways. i'm sti,2
This skirt is adorable. there is no give to it though. i usually wear a 4/6 and got the 4 and i can't gain a pound or it won't zip. it is perfect for spring and summer. i'm 5'8 135.,2
This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'4 and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.,2
"I recommen only becuase i like it on other people  but not on me. the pull on style didn't work  i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist  but the waist wasn't elastic enough to ""pull up"" (i have let's say a booty#. i kept hearing hte stiching give... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae  i am 5'1.5"" and it stuck more out than on the model. nice idea  btu not for me. #i am 115 lbs#",1
"This is a beautiful dress  just not for me though. since i'm 5'10"" it hit me 2-3"" over my knees. the colors are vibrant- would look good on most!",2
I saw army green pants similar to this in the store  but then found these on line and ordered them instead. i love them. they stretch out a bit so i am glad i sized down. i could possibly have sized down even one more size. i got a 27. the waist is very comfortable  so maybe this is just the fit...after all  they are basically stylish fatiques. either way  they are casual but on trend. i have planned a ton of outfits in my head already because these pants will go with so much! i think the cuff w,2
"I purchased the pink top and really like it. it will be a ""go-to"". the material is light but not skimpy  and it has a nice drape to it. the length is good for me (5'4"") and it fits tts.",2
"After seeing this dress online i wanted to try it on and was not disappointed when i did. even though the coral color dress of the same style was pretty it wasn't the right color for me. i absolutely love the blue and white dress! i usually wear a size 8 but found the 6 was more flattering. i'm 5'2"" and the length was perfect - above the knee but not too high. love it!",2
It is a cute top and i loved the fit and it's super soft feel  but i'm kind of getting tired of the sheer shirt thing this year. i bought this for the summer and it's hot here so not wanting to have to wear a shirt under my shirt. it's not crazy sheer  but still undecided. if you live in a state with no sweat  you'll probably be fine. :) i'll have to walk around and try it in different lighting situations and think about it?,1
I received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror. it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans. i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see. the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure. it is longer as it appears on the model. i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price!,2
"Ordered the ""white"" tee  but when it arrived today  i was surprised by how cream it looked.the cut is nice and as other reviewers mentioned  it is on the sheer side. still on the fence of whether or not i'll keep it.",1
I wanted to love it  but it's pretty pricey for a sweatshirt & the key hole in the back with the bright pink ribbon just looks odd. the stitching & beaded detail around the bottom hem & the cuffs is gorgeous  but the sleeves were way too long on me and just looked silly. unfortunately this will be going back.,0
I adored this suit - the style  the colors  the thick quality of the fabric...but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much  it was practically painful! i'm 5'7'  128 lbs  and usually wear a size small  but was advised to size up. even with the medium i tried on  everything fit well but the length  though i've never thought i had a long torso. sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest. was so sad to return this suit!,1
Flattering  comfortable  and a fantastically versatile color and style. if you'd like the garment to fit about how it does on the model  i'd say that it's tts. the picture represents the color accurately - is a very dark  slate grey. i've found that the color is a great neutral - i can wear it with other neutrals or with colors  as featured on the model. the style is also really versatile - i can wear it as a stand-alone t-shirt  or under a blazer to work.    i've washed the garment once on the,2
"I love pj's and other assorted lounging pieces  and this one is exceptional. in fact  i plan to buy the pj bottoms made with the same fabric. i tried them both on in the store  and ultimately decided on the chemise because it is very special.  the fit is tts. fyi: 36c  short waist  broad shoulders  5'3""  i normally wear a m/l in a chemise  and i chose a m in this one. there is plenty of room  but it is more fitted to my shape as a chemise should be. the piece shows curves  without showing bumps",2
"This is a beautiful dress for fall. the fabric is gorgeous and drapey and the skirt is swingy. i ordered this in an xl because that size always sells out first. i think a l might fit a bit better  so i will see if any more come in and order another to compare. it poofs out in the back above the elastic and the waist slides down a bit. it is also very long  i need to hem it about 3-4"". i never know which size to order with this brand  i vary between l and xl.",2
Runs a little big. fabric is very soft and comfortable,2
I love the idea of this top  but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back  the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric  i wo,1
I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off.,0
Okay  so i have an upcoming day of travel with four kids  a husband on crutches  and a flight leaving at 6am for which i have to leave my house at 4am  followed immediately by a le cirque show upon our arrival. i've been looking for something to wear during this chaos and this is it. the fabric is dreamy-soft  and the drape  perfect. yes  it looks like a dress  but i am happy for the conservative pants/jumpsuit it actually is. the pockets hold my phone without sagging  and i can wear sneakers du,2
Note: if you have a large chest  the seams hit in an unflattering spot. nice shirt  just not great for the price.,1
This jacket is beautiful! the embroidery is very well done! the jacket is fully lined in black. i usually wear a l/xl and definitely needed the xl as it runs a little small.,2
"I have a short torso and short arms  so i purchased this in a petite medium. i probably could've worn the ps  but i do like the little extra room. it is a classic shirt dress with just enough of today's trendy ""frayed edge"" to make it contemporary. the fabric is super soft and lays nicely. i can imagine wearing this through the seasons with a variety of shoes/legwear & accessories! looking forward to it.",2
The details on this are beautiful. i love the gold thread and white beads. i thought the medium fit too large and got the small. it seems to fit really well. so you might want to size down one size. the only thing that seems a bit off it the length. it's pretty long.,2
This top has a really pretty pattern and is good quality  but was just too boxy for me. i also felt like the sleeves were a little odd/big.     the fit is tts  though slightly shorter then it looks on the model.,1
It's just as cute in person as it was in the picture. the material is very  very soft and 'sweater like'. i ordered my usual size and it fit fine  but i usually wear my dresses a bit looser. i liked it well enough to return it for a larger size.,2
Love this tank! it's super soft and has a lovely drape. i got 3 colors on sale and am so glad i did!,2
I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs  32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.,1
I love this style and was pleasantly surprised that it fit my curvy shape well  despite it being a fairly straight shift style. it does wrinkel easily because of the linen fabric  but otherwise is really perfect! it is dressy enough for bridal showers or brunches but could also be worn casually.,2
I saw this online and didn't think twice about it but then i came across it at my local store and it's so much better in person! it is incredibly soft and cozy! i purchased the gray stripe version and two solid color versions (cream/forrest green.) i can see this being a great staple over the fall/winter with leggings  boots and a long pendant.,2
I have to disagree with earlier reviewers who suggested this top isn't flattering for larger-breasted women. i'm breastfeeding  so i currently have dds that are the bane of my existence  and i was very happy with the way this top fit across my chest. i didn't give it a full 5 stars for aesthetic/design only because i wish it were a bit longer. it hit me below my waist  but not below the crotch of my jeans where it hits the model (possibly because she is not burdened by swollen breasts). the shir,2
I purchased the dress with the bow-back shift in peach because i loved it's nautical theme pattern.  when i recurve do the dress  i found it to be stiff and boxy.  being a petite  short-waisted person  the top portion of the stress hung on my body awkwardly.  my bra strap was showing in the back  and the dress needed to be pulled up about 2 inches to properly sit on my frame.    i returned the dress,1
I love the fabric and design of this dress. you will definitely get noticed. and it's comfortable - just slip it on and go!,2
I love the mustard color and fun boho details of this shirt  however the sizing was a little weird. i ordered the small petite first and it was just too short (which is rarely a problem i have)  so i ordered it in the regular small. it's perfect in length  but a little loose on top  which i'm fine with. overall  very happy with this purchase and have received many compliments on it.,2
I am a big fan of ag  i'm sure i have 15-20 pairs. i will say that i have rejected some of their offerings in the past because the fabric has been weird: denim that is so stretchy it doesn't look like real denim  fabric is so thin it shows every lump or bump etc.. so i'm always cautious  especially with their stretch twill. that aside  these particular jeans in this gray color are awesome. ag nailed it: great color  supportive  slimming fabric  great length and rise. a job well done ag!     howe,2
Was scared at first to order this product  when i tried it on i was amazed on how good it looks. fits just like the model picture  and the material is awesome.,2
I love charlie pants. i've bought a few in the past  and i've never been disappointed with quality  style  or fit. i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result. i wish more pants were side zip- so much more flattering than having that part stick out under fitted shirts. i got these in a 4  my usual size  and while they fit a little more snugly than my other size 4 charlie pants  there is enough stretch that they don't look or feel too tight. i also got these in the regular  r,2
This piece was so gorgeous that i bought it despite how impractical it is to wear it in honolulu. it's honestly the perfect little number to wear if you want to go for a late autumn/early winter stroll in the city. it's incredibly comfortable and versatile. i've worn it on cool mornings in honolulu as a dress with booties  and a few months ago  i wore it to minneapolis and added leggings and a warm pea coat. depending on how you choose to accessorize the look  it can be casual or professional. i,2
"Love this coat. it fits very well - i'm 5'6"" and typically wear an 8. it is a bit broad in the shoulders like the other reviewers mention  but that's part of its tailored look. this gorgeous coat breaks up any boring winter outfit. so happy with this purchase.",2
I like the unique design and it's warm and cozy. i wear a medium 95% of the time  but had to exchange this for a small  but the sleeves are still long enough. it sheds a bit  but i'm guessing it will slow over time.,2
Very comfortable top  exactly what i was looking for on the hotter summer days. the white is a bit sheer  but a nude strapless worked just fine for me. i also bought the pink and it is a very pale  soft pink. the material is super soft like typical cloth & stone products.,2
I got the green one. as the other reviewers commented  yes  the fabric is thin. however  i wear it with a nude bra and a nude cami and i've had nothing but compliments!,2
This is a very pretty top with a nice flow. i love the delicate pattern. it fits perfectly and is great for work or the weekend.,2
But  it just doesn't measure up. first  the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and  once on  the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately  i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute  but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.,0
I ordered this dress in a 12 which is my usual size and it was tight around the waist and across the back. i am 5'7 170lbs  small chest but broader shoulders and back and curvy butt. this dress is beautiful quality and well made but was too snug. it was very long  to the point where i would only be able to wear heels. the belt is cheap looking  i would recommend replacing it with something nicer. the waist drops slightly below the natural waist and the top puckers over it in the front and back.,1
$20 for super comfy  warm leggings. bought two pairs for myself and another pair for my mother. let's be honest  i'll probably be buying another pair.,2
I like this shirt  want to love it. i am keeping this shirt hoping to have better arms by summer when i can where this top with black shorts. this shirt does cling  it's a draping sort of fabric; i love how it drapes in the front. only because i am not happy with my arms do i where a cardi with it. also  the underarm area is rather open so i'll wear a bandeau when i wear this without a cardi.,2
I have received so many compliments. it's my favorite,2
"I went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress  and i'm so glad i did. the fit was perfect. i'm always a little hesitant about long dresses since i'm 5'2""  but the petite length was perfect. the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable  but i feel elegant in it. i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month.",2
"The sweater coat is a must try on! it's a great fall to winter coat  that you can leave on all day if you need. i bought the dark green  which is very dark yet gorgeous and have the beautiful coral saved in my cart as well. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  ordered the size small and have plenty of room (did not want it tight and wanted to be able to wear over thick layers).",2
This is a pretty blouse that is also very comfortable. i am always an xl in retailer tops  but i needed to go down to a large on this one. this blouse is cut generously everywhere  but going down one size was perfect for me. the fabric in the back falls from the shoulder blade area  so it has a very nice drape in the back. the sleeve cuffs and placket are some sort of cotton  so the cuff made a nice base to fold the sleeve around and up to the elbow. i wore a nude bra underneath  and i can't see m,2
Way to v necked- other than that would be a nice go to top. needs a cami.,2
This top is stunning. the colors are vivid and it is extremely cozy and soft. however it seems delicate and would need to only be worn once in a while. it is not an everyday top. the material has a cotton candy like appearance. it really is unique and one of a kind.,2
The design is gorgeous and the fabric feels great. not a lot of functionality  then again i did buy the kimono to feel sexy and not to keep warm! i ordered the xsmall/small and feel i should have ordered the med/large. unless you're super tiny/fit  i'd recommend sizing up here. i bet it would still be super flattering a touch larger!,2
This sweater totally caught my eye online and when it arrived  it was even better than on the website. gorgeous colors---kind of a retro look  but more modern and updated. very happy with my purchase!,2
I purchased this in the ivory color in store and liked it so much i ordered the plum color on-line. i am almost always an xl  but this fit better in the l size. it's very soft and comfy and i love the swingy style. will be wearing it a lot!,2
I wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return  even on sale price :( agree with previous reviews: bodice too tight  neckline too high/chokes  fabric is rough  outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas. too bad...so sad!,0
"I'm 5'8 - 38""?30""?38"" - i bought these leggings in a size large (blue motif) to wear under a really cozy organic cotton tunic in an attempt to create a sophisticated-looking  comfortable look. when i first it them on they felt like compression leggings and i wondered if they were too small. i wore them for a day and now they are falling down around the waist and the crotch is hanging. i spend so much time trying to hike them back up - i'm not at all comfortable and i doubt i'm looking sophistica",1
I love these pants - the color is great  the style is comfortable and easy but can be dressed up. like other reviewers  i washed these according to the care instructions and they shrunk horribly. however - after some googling  i was able to find a fix. soak the pants for 5-10 minutes in warm water mixed with 3-4 tsp hair conditioner. gently wring them out and start to (gently) stretch the fabric as much as possible. hang on a drying rack and continue to gently stretch the fabric as the pants dry,2
I love everything about this dress! i love the colors - style and fit. it is so comfortable. i had so many people ask where i got it.   i usually wear an xs or s in retailerpolgy dresses and i got this in an xs and it was perfect.,2
Yes  this top runs large and it doesn't show your curves  but it's still really cute and fun to wear. i first purchased the beautiful sage color  and after getting compliments  i also ordered the navy version. these tops are easy to wear  have an interesting detail at the neck  and could be layered. cozy  comfortable  stylish. love mine!,2
I really liked this top  but it was very expensive even when on sale  and it ended up being boxy. i am flat-chested (32a)  5'7'. if i remember correctly  i tried on the xs. it was cute  but it wasn't flattering because it was so boxy on my frame. perhaps it'd be more flattering on other body shapes. i think it would be cuter if it was a bit more fitted. otherwise  the quality seemed great  though i'd be worried about all the beading falling off eventually.,1
This top is super comfy and casual. the slit/design in the front gives it more of a stylish look than your average white long sleeve tee. would definitely recommend.,2
This dress was so comfortable  i wore it all day - to church  out to brunch and actually slept in it. it would travel well  too.,2
The texture  mixed yarn  and beading make for a lovely variation on the fairisle. as other reviewers have said  the length is not as long as it appears in the picture. the color is a very dark navy  almost black. the neck opening is larger than a standard crew sweater but lays mostly flat. the overall look is boxy. i'm 5'7 and normally wear a medium in retailer sweaters. i changed to a large so it would be longer and have a roomy drapy feel.,2
I love this dress. it is beautiful and the quality is superb.. i too found it tight in the neck area. i had to untie it as other reviewers have mentioned. nice casual dress.. very comfortable and perfect for vacation this summer.,2
As-advertised crop sweater is a great length. design is an iron-on velvet texture rather than intarsia. weight of sweater is great for transitional weather.,2
I ordered this online in a sz 4  perfect fit and very comfortable. the side slits make it even more interesting since jeans or leggings will show!,2
I received this coat today and i'm ecstatic about my purchase. i am a true petite  and the petite large in this coat fit perfectly. i was a little worried about the sizing based on the other reviews. yes  the button is low  but that is the style. i strongly suggest ordering a petite if you are short. otherwise  the fit may be completely off.,2
"I hesitantly ordered this cardigan after it spent weeks in my basket. i love it! i am usually ""large"" by retailer brand standards at 5'4"" 145 lbs  but the small fit quite big and i'm glad i didn't go for the larger one. it is super unique and cozy. i gave it a 3 on quality because the knit is a bit itchy and the fibers do come off on other layers. it also is longer than i expected  it hits about my mid thigh.",2
The online picture does not do this skirt justice. it's very pretty and unique in design. i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture. this is truly a pretty pencil skirt.,2
For the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back. would have been a classier  more finished looking garment. if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look.,2
I like the red color and the border detail at the neckline. i'm not crazy about the way the zipper on the back is emphasized. i'd rather have a less visible zipper. overall it is a cute and comfortable dress. the fabric is soft and substantial and has a nice texture to it. the shape is basic so it can be dressed up or down.,2
These jeans are buttery soft and very flattering. unlike many jeans these do not ride down my waist as i wear them. i am a bit concerned about them long term as they list rayon as the primary fabric  which means they have to be washed very carefully. still  i highly recommend.,2
I fell in love with this top when i first saw it in the store  and bought it during the 25% off sale. i'm petite  32dd  usually a size 4. i tried the xs and s and while both fit  i like the roominess of the s so i got that size. i bought the regular size for a little extra length  but could have worn the petite. it's great for layering because of all the bright colors  and although the front is polyester  the back is knit so it's nice and cool. i personally love loose-fitting  shorter tops  so i,2

"I was wondering whether to purchase this top and decided last weekend during the 20% off event  i would splurge!!! i got the m as i'm tall (5'10"") and it does look a little strange on the arms atleast on my body. the sleeve is cut too high for me. i wish it was longer or even a long-sleeved item! the peach-apricot- nude colored fabric is a little uncomfortable and the fabric close to the neck is a different grey from the other sweatshirt pieces. the sweatshirt pieces aren't particularly soft eit",2
"I tend to like grey  black simple clothes with a splash here and there for everyday. this will be perfect in the fall/winter. it is wool  so be prepared for the felted wool feel  but it is casual comfortable. i am 5' 4"" and boxy. the medium is still roomie on me but that is how i like it.",2
This a great dress! bright colors  soft material and comfortable! the body of the dress is voluminous  so i found it to be a definite swing dress. i can see why it sold out the first time it was offered!,2
Love me some pilcro jeans! these fit like the stet jeans.    i got my usual size 27p and the fit is good but not too tight. i am not crazy about the hem but they feel so good that they are worth it. they don't come above my ankle like on the model but come slightly below which i really like. i will say that if you want a true black  you may not like this color. they are more of a faded black.,2
This skirt is adorable and has a beautiful pattern! it's also extremely comfortable. a total steal at the sale price!,2
I tried these on in the store and didn't buy them with the other items in my 'yes' pile. i couldn't stop thinking about them and ended up ordering them. they are so cute. the fabric is a nice weight. they have little stretch.,2
This tunic is comfortable and casual. it is as pictured and flattering. the two materials make it flattering. i ordered the white  and it is see through. it really does need a camisole  which i found a little distracting given the fact that it is already layered. i which i had ordered another color  because it is cute.,2
Unique  sophisticated and versatile summer dress that you will fall in love with. dress it up with heels for a night at the gallery or dress is down with a denim jacket for an easy day look. it needs no accessories. this silk dress is soft and it lays beautifully. you will want to wear it all summer long. fits tts. love it!,2
Beautiful top marred only by the armholes. i tried a small and a medium but alas  my bra showed under the arms. i my be overly endowed for this top  but the way it cuts  you would have to be braless to wear it. not for me  but wish it worked. it is really pretty.,1
I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.,0
I'm seriously in awe of this fun dress! the beading  fuzzy flowers and embroidery on the peachy dress make me very happy. it's nice to wear by itself with a simple necklace but i love it more with my cropped jackets--my dark denim for a casual air or the tailored tuxedo black for date night! like others have said  this dress has many layers and is surprisingly heavy. definitely not for hot humid weather or i'd melt and cry.       thank you so much to the reviewer who advised sizing up for the ar,2
Gorgeous material  great length for tall girls  warm without being too heavy  super soft. i ordered the grey and white in small and have returned them for extra-small. i feel like they run a bit big though i seemed to have gone down a size at retailer in the past year  not sure if its vanity sizing. this is a classic sweater and a timeless staple - elegant and sophisticated. the grey is that nice soft grey that doesn't wash a fair complected person out and is flattering with all complexions. great,2
"On shopping trips i try to try on at least one thing that i like but don't think will look that great on me. this dress was that item today. not only did i like it  but i liked the way it looked on me. i'm 5'3""  140 pounds and purchased the medium. i loved it  the clerks loved it  and my very honest daughter also loved it. i will wear it as a dress and also as a tunic over skinny jeans.",2
I ordered this in a l online  and wasn't a fan when i received it. the colors are pretty bright  but they also look cheap in my opinion. it also had an awkward fit  because of the material there is no give at all  it was really tight on my chest (36d) for reference. and it was also pretty short  and i'm short! it barely hit the top of my pants...and i'm 5'2! back it went.,0
This dress is very comfortable. the fabric is really nice and the dress flows when you move. classic and pretty. i ordered a xs and i'm 5'3 135lbs 34b and the fit was great.,2
This bra is the one. i have been searching high and low to replace my worn out comfy bra  and this is it. if you are looking for a wireless bra with thin straps that can peek out from your shirt and not announce themselves as hello bra straps  a v-neck cut (none of that scoop cut nonsense)  and you don't care about trying to boost your cleavage  this bra has it all. so comfy too.,2
I wanted to love this top. perfect weight  length  and shape. unfortunately  the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top  this will be lovely on you.,1
The color of this dress is just so beautiful - somehow both rich and airy! i believe this is meant to be a more relaxed fit  but that isn't quite my style. so to achieve more of a silhouette  i was lucky enough to stumble upon an xxs-p (petite) in store. i normally would never even try something on in this size  but it looked pretty generous so i decided to give it a try. so glad that i did! it gave more figure and i liked the length a bit shorter. with this dress  i think you can achieve the lo,2
I really wanted to love this dress! the quality is great  and the overall look is so lovely. however  i tried two different sizes (petite s and petite xs) and it still looked too baggy/big. the upper part is wider than it appears. also  the photos shows the bottom two buttons buttoned up. however  the dress doesn't actually have any loop holes or button holes  so it just hangs open. very sad to have to return both dresses.,1
Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small  are really tight from the thigh up  run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work  and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made  like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model  they would look good,0
Looks great on. fits beautifully ,2
"I did purchase the pants but ultimately ended up returning because everything such as the print and the length it hits at your ankles is great but there was  at least for me  a lot of extra fabric in the crotch area (and this is not to be crude  there really isn't another word that i can use) and when you sat down  it is extremely apparent. i am 5""6' and run between a size 8 and 10 and 10 fit me  but again  i just think if there was less fabric in the saddle  it wouldn't ride up and look more fl",1
I loved these when i first got them. they fit perfectly and are the softest and most comfortable pair of cords i've ever owned. plus ag is the only brand of jeans i buy. unfortunately  they stretch out horribly within one wearing. for such a pricey pair of cords  i'm extremely disappointed. i'm not sure if i should've sized down  but now i'm wishing i had  although i'm not sure that would make a difference.,1
I purchased this in blue. it has a soft fabric and seems well made. i have worn it several times and think it is quite comfortable. i bought one size up due to comments on the site  but my daughter thinks i should have stuck to the size chart.,2
This top is really cute and i love the design. however  the first time i wore it  the waste band started unraveling.,1
Love this top. i ordered the pink and it was more of a dusty rose. it also runs large - i normally wear a medium top. i am going to exchange it for white in small.,2
I bought the xs in green and every time i wear it i get compliments all day. it's a more youthful style than i usually wear but i couldn't resist the dark green color. i wear this with black leggings and flats and it's a perfect dress for a school day.,2
I really loved the fabric of this dress  however  it had a weird fit and the pockets made the front hang funny.,0
This dress is stretchy and soft  a great length  and an out of this world pattern. it will probably be flattering on every body  but it certain flattered mine.,2
I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly  but is more flattering that way.,1
I love this sweater combo! as a larger woman  i am always looking for flattering tops. the draping in front covers all the right areas! i wish they made them in more colors!,2
I absolutely loved this dress and when i received it  it was exactly the way it looked/fit online. the material is so pretty and the fit was amazing. it was a bit wrinkled  but i'm used to ironing things  so that didn't bother me. unfortunately  i had to return it though because of the color. i'm filipino  and this yellow just isn't flattering on someone with dark/tan skin. yellow is a tricky color for me to begin with  but this was more of a mustard yellow and just totally wrong for my coloring,2
This is great without a belt  with or without leggings. it drapes just right and is flattering for big busted  big behind women (like me).,2
"This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished! it is not a ""cheap polyester"" fabric as one reviewer wrote. it is a rayon and nylon blend. it does wrinkle easily. i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back. i don't typically gravitate toward warm color palette  but the burnt orange color is really lovely. it can be dressed up or down very easily. and it has pockets! i typically wear xs in retailer brands  and the size 0 fit me well.",2
"As most have already commented  runs small in upper body. i'm always a 2 or 4 petite (5'1""  120# max  36aa  athletic build). the petite s was exceptionally small in upper body and no chance of it stretching enough to be comfortable. since i read other reviews before purchasing i also ordered the petite m. pm was too big under arms. i exchanged both and purchased a regular s in store. fits great  though would have liked it a mere 1"" shorter. the sizing should have been 2 4  6 etc. i'm keeping the",2
Bought this dress for my daughter (teenager) and it is perfect. it is a cute dress  perfect for summer parties  special occasions. it seems to run a little small and  wrinkle easily  but over all  she and i both are happy with the dress.,2
Cute and comfortable! i loved the colors and how soft the shirt is!,2
This dress is the absolute best. it is comfy  flattering  cute - pretty much the best dress ever. as a previous reviewer said  ti is a 3 - even 4 - season dress. throw it on with boots and a wool cardi in the winter and youre all set. i didnt even think twice about buying it. perfect length- a little longer in the back but not too short in the front (and i do not like short dresses/skirts). dont think about it... just buy.,2
I simply love this jacket. it's comfortable  soft and has a relaxed fit that is easy to wear. i wish i had bought mine while it was on sale.,2
"This dress is a beauty. i am 5'11"" and plan to wear this as a tunic over leggings or straight leg pants. the embroidery is really pretty  even though it does run a bit big. i would have liked a size 12 or less but it was completely sold out except for a size 14. it is so nice  with gorgeous high quality denim that i will make the best of it - may need to get some tailoring but in my mind  this dress is so worth it.",2
I work from home so i'm always in search of tops that are comfortable and cute  but don't make me look like i'm waiting for company to arrive. this is a great addition to the wardrobe. super comfortable  it has shrunk slightly with a few launderings  but it's still wearable.,2
Thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat. i got a size small  (120  5'6) felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth. very unflattering. another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom?.adding to the overall bad look. i had it on for about 20 seconds and put it back in the bag to return. din't have to ponder about it at all.,0
I bought this top in my usual size in a small. i'm a 34 d 26 waist. i absolutely love it. i pair it with a red cardigan. very cute.,2
I loved the color and style then put them on and didn't take them off! they are so comfortable cane believe it. they are going to be my fall staple,2
Classy tunic can be worn with jeans or leggings. neckline is small but stretches so it goes on easily. color is perfect for spring. my only word of caution.....the design can add a bit of bulk around the middle so probably not your best bet if you are tummy conscious.,2
I loved the color of the top and the faded look but unfortunately had to return it because it was too boxy and just looked frumpy,1
"Only thing is the fit is a little loose  so i wish the xxs petite wasn't sold out (or that there was a xxs#. at 115 lbs  i tried on e xs regular  that made the skirt a maxi on me #5'1.5""# and it was nice  but a bit loose. i would have worn it as a sexy strapless #i tried it  just not daring enough to actually wear it like that). so i ordered the xs petite  we shall see.    the navy and beige is a nice classy combo  i could see it being pulled off in all seasons  depending how you pair it.",2
I loved these shorts; however  they seemed to be doomed! i received these on july 2nd & wore them at for a party we had on july 3rd  with the top shown. the fit was true to size  style & quality were nice. during the day i first ripped them on a low arbor gate latch  then later they were splashed with red wine when my husband startled me & i threw my red wine in the air. typically  i am very careful and do no have an issue with ruining my clothes. he felt so bad he asked me to get a new pair. i,2
This tank is great - goes well with black pants of skirt. it's a nice texture that doesn't show too many wrinkles so will travel well. it's a bit hard to get the buttons done in the back of the neck  but i assume that will get easier with time.,2
This is my first pair of mcguire jeans  and i like the fabric and fit.  thank goodness for petite sizing!  these 32p fit just right on my hips  with no gap between the waistband and my body.  fits through thigh and hips and pretty slim all the way down.  nice stretch.  of course  the proof will be after wearing a few times and washing.  i will update my review if i do not like them so much after that ,2
I am torn about this top. on the one hand  it is beautiful in all aspects:  flattering cut  beautiful detail at neck  victorian neckline  ivory color  flattering on most skin tones  including my very pale skin  speck of gold in fabric  it is lines with gold thread    bummers: it is see-through  as in you can see through the neck part. the picture online shows a more covered look  i think the model ash a shirt underneath. on me  you really see the skin through. so i will have to try with a nude b,1
I tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer.,0
"I just received these jeans today after buying them online last week. i wasn't sure how they would fit  but i am so very happy i got them. and on sale too!! i am 5'2"" and about 128 pounds. athletic and curvy but petite too. i bought the size 4 and they are a perfect fit in the length too. they are button up  boyfriend style but not too baggy. the detail on the cuff is perfect and they have a unique  unusual but expensive look. what a steal !! i would have paid full price for jeans that fit this",2
A lovely  creatively designed tunic that just isn't for me.  the embroidery is certainly intricate and the chambray shirt has a wearable hand  but the combination on my body type didn't look quite right  probably because i am too top heavy and apple torsoed.  i think if i were more slender  the fit would look like a flattering dress.  i had purchased the size 10 and i am 36dd 140#.,2
This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops  and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering  falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately,1
I dig this jacket very much because i can wear it like a thick shirt or as a jacket  and the removable collar gives even more versatility. i am short so i opted for regular xs (i'm 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips)  the bit of spandex stretch helps me achieve the fitted look without looking too tight. i love military green color  it's a happier neutral than black or brown. without saying  it goes with everything and flatters all body types.,2
I purchased this early in summer and have worn it a lot. you can dress it up or down  and since it's comfortable you will want to wear it a lot. i can wear it for everything from walking the dog to going out to dinner.. i bought 2 jumpsuits this summer and this is by far my favorite. the fit is flattering  fitted but not tight and the self-tie belt gives your waist definition so the overall look is hourglass. i am tall and i normally take an xs or s. i went with the s to ensure that it was long,2
The xxs petite fit great except in bust and shoulder area. i'm a 32a and it was really tight.,1
This tee is very pretty - i purchased it in the grey/purple combo. i usually wear a medium in this brand just because i don't like my tees to be fitted but i found this one to be a little too loose for me so i should have sized down to a small.,2
Just got this vest in my store yesterday and i was immediately drawn to it. the outside of the vest is this thick knit in an oatmeal color and a bright cobalt blue (even brighter than it appears online). the inside is a jersey knit fabric in grey. its an eye catcher for sure. i knew i needed to try it on. the vest is longer in length (like it appears in the photos). my only gripe is the fit. its great around the neck...nice and full. but i wish the body of the vest was larger. it fits very much,2
"This one is a beauty! my store is not carrying the white - they had a lovely blue (periwinkle-ish) that immediately caught my eye. the ivory model shot makes the details of the lace and top layer really pop - more so than the blue variety but both are stunning. the details and layers on this dress are lovely and intricate without feeling overly delicate. quality most definitely in line with the price.     fit: 130lbs/34c/5'6"" high waist. i'm a 4 or 6 at retailer depending on the brand. in most mou",2
One of my first rompers  it's super cute. i need to get used to the puffy sleeves but my husband also really likes it and he's definitely got an opinion about these things.,2
The picture makes it looks like it has rich brown yellow and orange colors. when it came  it was more black with some orange that popped. much different then i expected. the material was nice and silky but i was not willing to keep something that was dry clean only. i sent it back.,1
"Oh  i wanted this dress to work! i bought it in green  red and the solid blue. all ran really small. i *just* fit in a 10  when i would normally take a 6 in retailer sizes (5'8"" and 140 lbs). as with many other reviewers  i also noticed that the zipper was a huge flaw. it took a long  slow motion to get it zipped because it would get stuck on the fabric variations. such a cute style  was really bummed it didn't work. i kept ordering it in other colors thinking i would hit the jackpot  but they wer",0
"Loved the fabric of this dress  and the slip that comes with it. i wish the waist line fit a little better though. i am 5'4"" with an athletic build and it looked really boxy on me. i was so disappointed. thought i could synch it in to make it work  but think this is a return.",1
"I loved this dress the moment i first saw it! i have another dress from this brand that i've had for a couple years and wear it all the time plus i love the tie waist detail. however after trying this dress in both a size medium (my typical size) and a small  i've given up. it does not look good on me and i think thats because i am a 34b  there is room in the chest even in the size small. so would look really good on a curvy girl! i'm 5'5"" ordered regular size and it came to just above my knees.",1
As the previous reviewer mentioned  this dress is great for a dress that doesn't have a true waist. it really fits awesome. so incredibly soft  high quality material  and the mesh pockets are perfection (pockets that are so small/light that you can't tell the dress even had them when looking at it!). the color of the dress is what initially drew me to it (definitely a different color for a sun dress) and after trying it on in stores i would say 'beware.' though it truly is a rich and different c,2
So comfy  great quality  not see thru at all  has a liner that you cant even tell is there. wish it was a little smaller- got an xxsp but going to keep it anyway  dont need a bra.,2
This sweater is such a cozy knitted dream. the mixed knit contrast trim/hood adds enough visual interest to keep it unique from other incarnations out there. it's a little open work but still snuggly warm with layers. the fit is very roomy but not sloppy looking  that's why i picked 'runs large' as you'd have to size down for a somewhat slimmer look. if i could afford to buy the other color now i would. i wish retailer would commission a green version. and a brown version. red too. what the heck ,2
This shirt runs boxy  but the print is as cute as it looks online,2
I love the color of this skirt  and the fabric is wonderful. it was a bit longer than anticipated  but fit well.,2
Love these-although i'm exchanging mine for a size larger. they are definitely wide leg  have plenty of length (i'm 5'6  and there is a good inch of extra length)  but i found the waist band to fit snug without a ton of give. i also am working off extra baby weight in the stomach/hip area though  but thought it was worth mentioning. i'm pretty curvey  probably a size 31 in jeans right now  and exchanged a l for a xl. great quality,2
"I love these pants  but they are a bit too long. like the reviewer below  they hit me right at the ankles. i am 5'6"". i am going to hem them a bit. also they were a little bigger in the waist than expected--could have ordered a size 28 instead of a 29.",2
"I didn't receive a jacket. i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it. jackets have some structure to them. for example they might nip in at the waist a bit. this cardigan doesn't do that. it hangs in a very boxy shape. the quality is great. very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details  but i don't need/want another cardigan.     i'm 5'5""  118 lbs and got a small. the small seemed big  but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st",2
Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.,0
Perfect summer dress: feminine  cool  with just the right flow. hides the bad  and has a nice shape.,2
I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful  and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous  but this one fits tts.     my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily.,2
This is a nice sweater  it is comfortable and a great top layer. it fits tts but be aware that when you raise your arms it rides up pretty high. i bought the grey/brown option. i find it to be more brown than grey.,2
I like this top because it covers the bum.  it is a little longer in the back than front.  it is cotton modal soft  and it is light enough for summer.  the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail. i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer  but classier than a tank top.  i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter.  i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility  material (for comfort)  and classical style.,2
The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.,1
"This is a stunning  flattering  well-designed and sized  magnificent  and yet wearable  comfortable summer blouse! i am a busty  34f  size 8  and this lovely piece makes me look amazing. i most highly recommend to any woman. the 100% cotton body has a very soft feeling and a little bit of ""give"". i experienced no pulling at the chest or back  which can happen for me. the bottom 2"" of the crochet v is backed by the body of the top  so you may not need a cami. the combination of leaf print/crochet",2
I ordered this tank  and was very pleased with the quality. each of the stripe colors has a different knit  adding an unusual and interesting look. it has a trim fit. i wear s and sometimes xs  but this fit perfectly in the s. i agree with the other reviewers that that armholes are the correct size- so nice not to worry about a bra showing in the armholes!,2
T.la got it right this time. love the fabric. the color is perfect for summer and the color is a great shade of green. exactly as pictured. the left side has a slight cut with silver buttons. exactly as it looks on line. i certainly recommend this top. love it.,2
"My only con would be these are long...even in petite they are long. otherwise i have no complaints. i love the comfortable fold over waist band! ah. i am planning to wear these on a long flight...they will help me look put together and keep my legs warm (i always freeze on airplanes) plus they will feel good! i am 5'4"" and must wear more than a flat sandal...i tried on with a wedge and it worked well. not sure if i will hem or not. might wait till after washing. lovely. ordered my typical pxs (d",2
Love these pants. ordered in petite . love style  great fit but so long .   keeping but have to get hemmed 2 1/2 inches.   decided to order the black & green as well.,2
Love this skirt! i have worn it to work with a simple black shirt for a great outfit! i have had many compliments on it. it is very flattering and comfortable!,2
This dress makes me this of jackie kennedy on the beach in the summertime. i love the pattern and the pockets  oh my goodness the pockets! i saw this in the store and ordered one while i was there online because the ribbon on the zipper was frayed. well guess what we i got it in the mail at home the ribbon was also frayed. ugh. i kept it because it wasn't a huge deal breaker. the color is a little strange  not a true red more of a orangish red. i think it's super versatile and hopefully i will w,2
"I needed a dress that was easy to throw on for summer days and this dress is perfect for that. it's flattering  light weight and unique. i've received a handful of compliments while wearing this dress. i am 5' 6"" 150 lbs  hourglass figure and typically purchase a small or medium (8-10) and chose a small for this dress. i'd say it's still loose on me- which is what i prefer. the scoop neck and cut out allows you wear a normal bra. however  i've noticed i'm more comfortable wearing a camisole or s",2
First  i'm an 8/10 and tried the s and m. i could've worn either but the m looked too large in my opinion. i kept the small. the color- i think you could wear black or navy as the navy is very very dark. the only con- the sleeves. they stick right out to the sides and don't lay down as much as the online photo. it definitely looks best with a cardigan or jacket over it. material is super light.,2
I adore this top! i ordered in the white and wear it with everything! i am a 34c and size 6 and purchased the xs. it was slightly snug in the arms but it does stretch. i just bought the black as well  as it truly it a great staple piece. forewarning: do not dry this! my husband accidentally did and i was forced to buy another one  since it shrunk so much. the fabric is lightweight and great for summer  but keep in mind that it is thin and may require something underneath (tank top  etc.),2
"I purchased the coral version  and the color is wonderful and vibrant. it fit my daughter beautifully  and she is 5'10"". i think she will be wearing this coat often  she loves it!!! she is 23 years old and has a professional job  so she will look the part.",2
"I'm a size 28 jeans 5'9 with a bubble bottom. these were falling off of me around the hips. these are warm. i was expecting them to not be sheer since they are fleece lined but when i sat down i was shocked to notice it. it doesn't matter functionality wise because i never felt a ""draft."" they look good and are well made but i will be returning due to the lack of fit.",1
"I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim thinking it be a great throwback to the 70s. it is actually very flattering on  with the lines running down vertical  giving a slimming look to any figure. it is also very soft and comfortable on  and has nice  large pockets on the sides. it doesn't look dated at all once on  and i'm sure will get plenty of use as the weather warms up. for reference  i'm 5'7"" tall  and weigh close to 130 lbs.  and found the small fit well. the only drawback was the pice  but i",2
First saw this jacket in the catalog  in peach  and had to have it. i received it today  and love it. its a soft  muted peach  very neutral. i ordered xl  im usually a m-l  but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy. the quality is great  feels good on. love it so much  i just ordered it in the dark grey. very classic jacket  will wear for years. one of my favorite hei hei pieces  never disappoints.,2
"Love the pockets and back of dress. the buttons on the the straps allow for them to be adjusted. that's a plus. i'm 5'3"" with an athletic build at 34d. the medium fits perfect",2
It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.,1
Ive been on the hunt for big bulky sweaters because winter is coming and i live in the north  i saw this sweater and needed to give it a try. i got it i the mail and its truly gorgeous and extremely well made. this is the type of sweater to wear on a cold snowy day. it runs a little big but thats okay with me because its perfect to snuggle up in. i love this sweater but be aware it is thick and bulky so its not made to make you look like a twig. i like big sweaters and this design flows from sma,2
This top is so soft and with a henley neck opening and longer ribbed shirttail hems  it not only feels heavenly against the skin but it gives off a casual chic vibe. it is also great for layering under shorter sweaters and sweatshirts to give my staples a little oomph. it is a bit sheer so cami is a must. i am also not sure how well it will hold up after washings  especially since it's priced quite high. i love it so much that i will most probably end up keeping it it is true to size. i ordered,2
This dress is adorable. i got it in red and it is very flattering. i love the shape - it has a slight flare without being too full. the fabric is firm so it holds a nice shape  and there is a stretchy material lining on the inside that make it very comfortable. my only complaint  and why i didn't give it a 5 star rating  is that the zipper sticks at the ribbon junctions. a bit frustrating  but not enough that i won't keep the dress.,2
This jacket is exactly what i was looking for! it is a lightweight and comfortable material that will be perfect for fall/spring (and for layering during a mild winter!). i am 5'3  128 lbs  and generally wear a small - but i ordered a medium in this jacket and am happy i sized up. the jacket is roomy  but the cinched waist makes it flattering rather than shapeless. i'd definitely recommend this anorak to anyone!,2
I love this shirt. i have it in red. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming.,2
Wore this romper 1x and after washing  the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again  i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.,0
Love this blouse. i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs  which fits perfectly. not form fitting but flattering; washes beautifully  too. i highly recommend this blouse.,2
After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it  i loved the fabric and color  however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!,0
"I love these laid back  causal pants. they have a draw string  very comfortable and can be an alternative to sweat pants  lounge wear  etc. i am petite  5'2""  100 lbs or a little less  and i got the xsma?l size. i am pretty proportioned  but my upper body is a little thinner. meaning  i don't have a straight  rail body. my petite frame  has curve to my hips  tush  so it isn't easy to find pants  jeans  etc that are automatically flattering. these trousers are cut well  of good quality and nice n",2
I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once  according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry  it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute.,0
I snagged this top with the 25% off sale and it's adorable. i got the white  and it goes great with some skinny jeans or tucked into a skirt. i found it ran true to size. my only complaint is that like some other reviewers have stated  it does wrinkly very easily. and i would say for full price i don't think the quality is worth the cost  but on sale  it's a great shirt.,2
The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.,1
Gorgeous!! get these while you can. tts. has a lot of stretch. these are so much fun and will sell out! so happy!,2
I purchased this for a recent trip with my friends and thought it was worth the price. the swimsuit is comfortable  yet flattering and all the patterns are really unique. i received a lot of compliments about the swimsuit! the one downside was that the fabric hook for one of the straps broke so i had to sew it back on. other than that  this was a great purchase! i recommend this to anyone who wants a very whimsical  but comfy swimsuit!,2
These run very large.  i wear a 25 or 26 in paige jeans  and the 25 in these shorts were way too big.  i fear if i got the 24 they would be a little short.,1
I really wanted to love this waistcoat. i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received it. it runs large  but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing. the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed  the hip area !!!!. i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs  but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size. it's going back  but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative !!!!!,1
This is a heavier weight shirt. it is fitted through the bust and shoulders and very loose below so  if you don't like loose fitting clothes  this is not for you. it is well made and looks cute with jeans.,2
This top does look better online and one reviewer said. it also looks good in-person but runs small. i usually wear xl  in some cases l. i tried l  it was small so i sent it back for xl. the xl fit perfectly at the top but was tight at the bottom. the bottom pulled at the seams  so i am sending it back. the embroidery itself is very pretty  it is a nice dressy top that can be worn with multiple colored pants or leggings. it just didn't fit me at the bottom. i think it would work better for a lea,2
I've been eyeing this for months and finally bit the bullet and am so happy i did before it sold out! i love it. i was afraid i couldn't pull it off because i'm 5'3 and very petite  but i don't think it matters. it feels so light and airy and i can't wait to wear it at the pool and the beach as well as over some white tank tops and jean shorts. great piece.,2
I loved this top  however had to return as it does run small. by the time it arrived they were sold out in the larger size. like the quality of cloth and stone  however their products do run a size small.,2
I love the fabric  since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance.  this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric.  the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down).,2
The blue lace with the white top underneath is very pretty. unfortunately i did not like how billowy it was below the bra line.,1
Love this shirt so much i bought it in 2 different colors. the reviews said it was so boxy and plain  but i disagree. looks great with jeans or a skirt without looking looking too casual. love that they are not too long also. so many tees are soon long and these are not thank goodness. definitely runs big,2
This was my first time ordering or even knowing about retailers. what a pleasant surprise. i will shop often!,2
I am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase. i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style. both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store. i wanted to wear them every day; received lots of compliments; felt that you could dress up or down; etc. this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing. on the second wear  i noticed threads coming out on the seams  but just on one side of one leg. this was irr,0
This is a review of customer service in general from several issues with online shopping! i don't understand why you ask for my opinion and say it counts when clearly it does not.i have had a lot of issues. receiving parcels from one of your carriers laser ship and i have reported the issues to them and retailer but it appears only the good parts are read.this poor service cost me money in postage and lost discounts but again i'm ignored and i had to order my last returned parcel again pay more fo,1
This bra is extremely comfortable and surprisingly supportive considering the lack of padding or firm material. it also runs large.,2
This blouse if very pretty and feminine. i agree with the other reviews that said it emphasizes the size of your hips. i don't have any so it was great for me!,2
I really wanted to like this jump suit.  i rarely have problem with retailer clothing.  i'm 5.6  hourglass shape  usually wear size 2.  this jumpsuit runs small  but that's not the only problem.  top part (shirt piece of the jumpsuit) is too short  so it's digging into my lady part.  the color does not look anything like the picture  so overall this piece is failure.  i hope that i find something similar but fits better.,1
I already have one pair of sleep pants by retailer and was looking for a second pair. i wanted something warm and comfortable for the fall and upcoming winter weather. (i live in the rockies.) as soon as i saw the woodland animal print on these pants i had to try them. i mean seriously  how cute are the raccoons and other critters here? when they arrived at first i thought they might be too thin for winter wear  but when i put them on i was pleasantly surprised by the soft  comfy fabric. i,2
This product is perfect for early fall wear. when the weather is a little cooler a shell worn under it will be fabulous,2
The print is even better in person! true to size. flattering fit.,2
I usually wear a 2-4 in retailer dresses and i was surprised the xs fit better than the s. very pretty  really perfect color for fall. i like that it's not tight or constricting so you can wear it for every day and not feel like it's difficult to move around. the longer length is nice too for. bonus that it's not dry clean only. my only problem with this dress is it's all polyester  which is just cheap fabric. if it wasn't for that  i'd give it 5 stars.,2
I wish there were be fewer asymmetrical tops in the store. i see many tops i like until i discover they have an asymmetrical hem and are longer in the back  which i do not prefer.,1
Beautiful summery dress with bright fun print. i think this was well worth the sale price i paid. it lays nicely and is flattering. i went down a size from my normal 8 to a 6. however as other reviewers have said  the arm holes/halter top is too blousy and no matter how tight i tied it or type of bra i wore  you can see bra on the sides. i'm going to get this tailored and then it will be perfect. can't wait to wear this on my vacation!,2
"The lace detail adds a nice spin to an otherwise plain tank. looks great under a cardi  jacket  sweater coat... for the most part it fits true to size. it's not as fitted as i hope it would be. at 5'1""  115lbs  i got my usual xsp. my biggest gripe is the very deep v-neck--its shows my bra. eek. it's like the strap could be shortened to help remedy it but then it may leave the arm hole too small or bring it too high up. perhaps it may shrink in the wash or i just need to get bigger boobs. maybe t",2
"If you are on the shorter side  do with the petite size. i ordered both (at first  petite was sold out) so glad i got to get it. i looked lost in the regular size  the back length was well below my bum. both colors are really nice  but i did end up with the orange one  more ""dressy""  red one looked more calsual (though it is a casual shiryt  i had on trousers  and hte orange looked nice with them).",2
"I did like this dress. it has a good simple shape  and is very comfortable. however  it's plain  and for the price and it being dry clean only  i'll wait to see if it'll go on sale. it's also worth noting that i'm 5'2"" and was uncomfortable with the length of the petite  but the regular size was a good length (right at the knees).",1
I love design of this top! it will look beautiful on many body types. the black material is thin  and for my personal level of comfort i will definitely wear a cami under. the details are gorgeous and the neutral colors easy to combine with casual or dressy bottoms. the top ran true to size for me.,2
Can't say enough about the style of this trench  the material is soft and the shape is amazing for all body types. the color is great and there's some pretty aqua colored piping in the inside of the coat.  the sizing is a little hmmm. i ordered a large. i'm usually a 12 on top or a large  mostly to accommodate a larger chest (ddd i think). proportion wise i'm more a medium through the shoulders and in length  so sometimes i can size down to a medium or large petite depending on the shape.  with,2
I bought the extra small and although i love the style and unique color combo  it's pretty large in the collar area and without the right blouse/shirt underneath it makes my neck look really skinny. the rest of the coat is true to size  longer and straight. the design just doesn't have the right balance for me so i'm sending it back.,1
I had to have this when i saw it in a store. i was drawn to the shape and the neutral colors. i wore it for the first time today with a black tank. on me it looks best unbuttoned. it looks good with pants. the small fit best although the arms are a little tight at the upper arms. i have muscles so i don't think i could wear it with any top with sleeves.,2
This dress is so much prettier in person - the pattern is unique  adorable and not over-powering. i'm an xxs petite and i can wear the dress with flats. (5ft) i think this is versatile enough to wear to work  party or a casual wedding. the fit is perfect - hugs at the correct spots. the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely. overall - i love it.,2
Just purchased this lovely sweater over the weekend during the 25% off sale. i went in to buy the rona sweater in grey (which i think is the same style with different name) but it was all sold out! the sa pointed me to a rack of these sweaters and i am happy with this choice! the back print is really cute and the sweater design and color is very flattering. it goes well with pants or skirt  and the front is not as short as i had imagined the rona sweater to be.,2
Just bought these today and they are super soft and beautiful. also  100% cotton (yay! i hate poly)! thought i should mention though that they do shrink in the dryer. so unless you're skinny  you might want to buy a size up or hang them to dry and then put in the dryer on low to fluff.,2
Just received this and absolutely love it! i tried the vienne cardigan in the store and i assumed this one would fit the same (since online exclusive)  which it does. this one though has the whimsical left grey sleeve with trees  a fence and sheep on the sleeve - very cute. it's a traditional knit design with a twist of modern design being the cape style. it is a bit cropped but fits well and the hood lays nicely. there were a few too many stray threads when i received that i needed to cut off.,2
"These pants are amazing and great quality! thank you to the reviewers who suggested sizing up one size. the trousers don't have a lot of stretch and are very cute and well-made and the size up is perfect! i am normally a 2r in most pants and skirts and i sized up to a 4r  they are perfect. gorgeous pattern  and i too  am not a ""pattern""-type. will go perfectly with a number of the solid  flowy maeve tops i have for work.",2
It is a proper fitting oversized shirt. however  it is very flimsy and even see-through as a summer weight shirt. i returned it because i don't want to wear a tank or cami under it during hot weather.,0
This was a cute design  but didn't work for me. the fabric was slightly see-through  and too tight around the bust.,1
I have looked at this dress a dozen times online and passed. after reading other reviews felt compelled to see why everyone is in love with this dress. when i opened the box i was blown away. this dress is so beautiful and the crystals  which look like sequence online are high quality  as is the fabric and craftsmanship.  a perfect 10!!!!!!!!!!!!  you must have this dress in your closet!!!!!!!  ordered my usual size and fits perfect.,2
I ordered this shirt in the xl in both colors and i am in love! as a large chested lady  with a bit extra around the middle  this shirt is super flattering and perfect for everyday summer weather. i'm sure i will be wearing this all summer. yay retailer!,2
So comfortable  fit just right  flattering  beautiful neutral color  but different  love the embroidery  nothing bad about it. that being said  i haven't worn them the whole day  i suspect they will stretch a bit. also have not washed them  so i hope the color stays the nice rich dark gray turquoise  the length is perfect too  i ordered the petite and they fit as on the model (for a change  i have pretty short legs). (115 lbs  26.5 in waist  muscular legs),2
Great quality- this sweater runs small and not as long as pictured in the catalogue. it's perfect over a longer undergarment underneath or over a sleeveless dress. i love the color & quality. i ordered on line & decided to keep it  yet wear it differently than i originally thought.,2
"I wanted to love this dress. i ordered an xsmall and a small. i am 5'6"" and 110 lbs  slender build. the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress. both sizes will have to be returned. possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist!",1
This is a quirky  whimsical  uniquely designed top that's sure to get a lot of comments and opinions (and hopefully good ones!). i really love it. think it is what it is  a fun  conversation piece.  and isn't that what's great about fashion? tts  very comfy  yes boxy  but i don't think in a bad way. the ruffle on the bottom is adorable. would look great with slim ivory or white denim and booties  or even a darker denim. hits mid bum. nice quality too.,2
I am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses  and i ended up with a 4 in this one. i could barley zip up the 0  and while i could have gotten away with the 2  there is no elasticity in the waistband. the 4 is very slightly roomy  but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me. for reference  i'm 109-111 lbs  5'4  and a 30b.     when i was finally able to wear the dress  i got compliments galore. it really is a beautiful dress! just be sure to size up!,2
Retailer is totally killing my wallet because i can't resist these modern-city-meets-prairie-boho dresses. i bow down to the textile designers who created this print  it's stunning. as for reality vs. model shoot  it's pretty much what you see--the colors are spot on  the outer dress is sheer  the bodice is slightly fitted  with a fuller skirt that doesn't poof too much. all poly construction with no stretch whatsoever. i had a bit of a struggle getting the outer dress over my shoulders but once a,2
"I am 5'2"" and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p. lately i've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress. it fits well and it's flattering. my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy. yes  linen is a wrinkly look and that's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me. more importantly  while wearing for the first time  i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there",2
"I didn't think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold. yes  it is see-through but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work. the best feature? even though it's silk and the tag says ""dry clean only""  you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry. i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles! i took my usual small (i'm 32c and 122 lbs) and love how versatile this blouse will be.",2
This is a cute dress. the quality is very good for a dress of this type. the fabric is not too thin and the stitching is perfect. i do think it runs a little small. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p and i purchased this in the regular xs. regular xs is typically way too big  but i took a chance on this one because i really liked it and i also like my dresses a little bit longer than shown on the models. surprisingly  it fit well in the chest and the armholes were not too big  as is often the case,2
Lovely crochet lace tunic. also very comfortable. doesn't wrinkle and the cotton has a lovely feel.,2
I got this sweater in white and i love it. the photo online doesn't do it justice  it's not frumpy at all and looks looks great zipped up because of the slanted zipper. my boyfriend calls it my claire underwood sweater.,2
This is going to be perfect for my daughter's graduation. she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her!,2
Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!,2
I am 5'8 154 pounds and ordered a medium. the coat is a bit bigger than expected and should have gone down a size. i'm keeping this size however because it is incredibly comfortable  roomy and perfect for mild winters. the wool does keep you warm in 50 degree weather.,2
"These are very cute and i bought both colors. they are accurately pictured. however  right out of the bag they had an especially strong chemical-type odor. must be the dye. i have been airing them outside in the sun trying to decide if i will keep them. they seem to be ""calming down"" a bit but it's been two days!! they are not jersey but are a non-stretchy type fabric with a slight sheen. dress up or down. i'm a 00 or 24 and the xs fit well.",1
I had never tried on a romper or jumper. the print of this changed my mind and i'm glad for it. it looks amazing on is easy to wear. i kind of wish it were lined but it's probably better unlined to keep it light and cool for the summer.     i did end up using double stick take bc the front was so low but it was worth it.,2
I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this  but this one didn't make the cut for me.,0
This is the most comfortable beautiful dress/cover up. i can't believe the sale price. when i ordered  my reg m was not available so i ordered a small. it fits except the top button (36c). i just called and got a m since there was one available today online. hoping it ships! so impressed with this! i'll wear in summer and spring with a white slip underneath.,2
I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25% off sale. i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isn't even silk or a better material. but once i got this i was so disappointed  i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me. i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress. plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way. i don't even want t,1
"Absolutely beautiful jacket...the craftsmanship is amazing  and the colors remind me of a impressionist water color. the jacket runs true to size (i'm 5'7"" and 115 pounds with a 30e bust and the extra small fit perfectly). unlike the other reviewers  i didn't have issue with the bottom not lying flat or the collar bunching up. i wore it with a green leather pencil skirt and suede stilettos  but you can also wear it with skinny jeans as well.i got this very deeply discounted  and although it is i",2
I recently noticed that my trusty black cardigan  that i've had for years  was getting thin in the elbows and just kind of ragged  so out i went on the long journey to find the perfect cardigan with detail. this cardigan fit the bill  with a perfect fit and lovely texture  making it not just your average sweater  to go with my style. can't say anything bad about it!,2
I am so amazed that i finally found the perfect  straight legged denim! not too skinny nor too tight b/c i have athletic calves. i have been waiting a long time! for reference i took a size 26 and usually wear a 2. it is great and comfortable for someone my age! i love these and they are the best investment.,2
I saw this in the store and had to try it on. luckily i grabbed a couple sizes before heading to the dressing room since i thought it looked large but wanted to get the best look. i normally wear a large in most retailer items and if you want a really roomy look you could go for your normal size but i liked it a little more fitted and ended up getting a small. i plan to wear it over jeans or leggings. the delicate embroidery and details are so pretty. the stick out sides look a little funny but if,2
"My favorite leggings. they are feminine and perfect with a long tee. the colors are vibrant  the material is high quality  plus they're comfy! i ordered an xs. i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs.",2
"This dress is quite the stunner! i love the mix of patterns and the asymmetrical hem. four stars in quality  though  as it could have a bit of pure cotton in the fabric composition  as opposed to rayon + viscose only. still  a versatile dress  for day or night. i love the length of the petite size (please note i'm 5' 4"") the shortest part of the hem hits right at the knees. a keeper.",2
I was happy to receive this sweater in no time at all. when i opened the package it seemed too thin  however  after trying it on  it's the perfect fit and style. can be worn with jeans or skirts and even dress slacks. great buy.,2
Love this top  looks really cute with a pair of high waist jeans. it is a nice thick cotton fabric that does not stretch out after wearing. it is short  so for me the high waist pants were a must  but if you don't mind showing your belly  then it would be cute with anything  the boat neck collar is not so wide that it shows your bra straps as with some. overall it was a good fit.,2
This dress is true to size  it looks sexy on the model but much more modest in person. great for work!,2
The rocket by citizens of humanity are my favorite jeans. perfect high rise and still makes the butt look good. they are incredibly comfortable. no more hiking up your jeans and bending over. love these so much. am very happy that j brand and citizens are making some good high rises now. won't buy anything else.,2
"This top does run quite large. i am normally an xs or s in tops (i'm 5'7""  130lbs  34a)  and i was debating between the xs and xsp. the xxs was out of stock  so i wasn't able to try it on for size. the xs is noticeably longer and fits more like it does on the model  but it was also a little too low cut for me on top. the straps are twisted and not adjustable  so i went with the xsp  which is what i'm wearing in the photo. it does come up a little shorter  but it fits me better in the bust. the f",2
I really like the warmth and loose cut of this sweater. it is great for layering and looks nice dressed up or down. my only gripe is i would love for it to have a second fastening. if it had another snap a little further down the body you keep keep it more securely closed. other than that it was a really great purchase.,2
Obsessed with black watch scottish tartan so this really hits the mark and goes beautifully with my joe fresh black watch print wellies rain boots. the wrap top is flattering but pulls on me ( i have this in the red and blue plaid as well.,2
"I can't wait for our warmer weather to arrive here in minnesota so i can wear this lovely tank top. the style is so flattering  it doesn't bag out to make you look pregnant. the back yoke is solid navy blue chiffon which is a nice touch. soft fabric  drapes beautifully. the armholes are not oversized. the fabric is opaque so no camisole required.    i am 5'5"" and 120 lbs. and 36a. i purchased size small.",2
Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend.,0
This is my favorite weekend jacket! it is so cute  soft and comfortable! the interior is an extra soft cotton that feels like my most favorite soft tee-shirt?? it is true to size. the best features are the versatility of the neck  pockets. and a little longer in the back - great over leggings/yoga pants. i ordered 2 sizes just in case the sizing was off - an xxs and xxs. i am a 2 petite and the xs is roomy enough for a sweater or sweatshirt under it. the xxs looked and felt great too and had a m,2
"You do not want to know how many cropped  wide-leg jeans i've tried on. all the rest make me look ridiculous for various reasons....it's not easy to get this style right  apparently. these are great: comfy  make my legs look cute  not chopped off  they are not mysteriously tight in the upper thigh (why do some do that?) they act like trousers with a jean's casual edge. the ""let out"" hem is super cute and they are soft and comfortable. perfect with tucked in or shorter blouse styles.    i bought",2
I love this cardigan! i ordered the pink and it's a really pretty color. i wish it didn't run so big but xs will be cozy all winter.,2
"Saw this in the catalog and had to have it.  i paid full price!   while the buttons aren't functional  it is not too revealing.  i work in a casual office and it will be perfectly appropriate especially paired with a jean jacket!   the length is right above knee.  i am 5'6"" 122# and went with the xs",2
I wanted to love this dress but there were too many factors that ultimately had me sending it back.    it is a very unique piece and high quality; however  i have sensitive skin c/o irish genes  and something about the silk/linen/sequin combo had be itching like crazy and really irritated my skin. i also did not love the way the top part of the dress layed on me- it was like there was a bit too much fabric up top meanwhile fitting perfectly around my hips (so i wouldn't want to size down...),1
Wearing these for the first time today. the way the pants are made is the way a pair of quality pants should be. the fabric is gorgeous; the fit is excellent. the tone on tone flower is subtle but visible and creates a lovely pattern. the denim treatment at the ankle and waistband is a nice added touch. true to size  too. these are not your run of the mill above the ankle pants - they're something special and worth the money...the fact that i did get them on sale makes it an even better purchase,2
Im so glad this shirt came to me just as pictured and described. color and fit was spot on! thank you!,2
Just received this in the mail  and i love it! the fit is wide and flowy  but i wouldn't say it runs large... i don't think i could have sized down in the shoulders. perfect easy  breezy fall top. cannot wait to wear it!,2
"I ordered a size 10 in the neutral motif and it fits perfectly and it looks great. i am 5'9"" 145lbs with 38"" bust. the sleeves are the perfect length. i couldn't be happier with this purchase.",2
The print caught my eye. then i felt the breathable cotton fabric and had to try it on. i am only 5'2'' and have a small waist but sized 32dd bust with hips and have a hard time finding clothes that fit well.. this dress fit me perfectly! i have dressed it up and down and always get compliments. this dress was on the pricey side but has turned out to be worth every penny.,2
This is simply the most lovely  interesting  flattering sweater ever. i got the green which is a lovely minty color. couldn't be happier!,2
I've been looking for the right red dress for a while and this one is a winner! flattering fit  comfy quality fabric...makes me feel great even right after having a baby. fits tts and i can't wait to rock this beauty!,2
"This is my third marrakech jacket in as many months. i love it! i was hesitant to order it because of the beige color. luckily it is more of a green beige. it is a very flattering jacket and yes  you do want to size up. this jacket is so comfortable i usually leave it on when i get home because i don't want to take it off. i am 5'5""  34 b and the medium fits great!",2
The high/low hem is interesting  and the fit looks great. i did find that i needed one size larger than normal.  maybe that's bc these are high rise?  there is also absolutely no stretch in the fabric.,1
My measurements: i'm a 36b so i got the medium. it fits perfectly. i originally purchased this in the gray to wear during the day in winter months  but i loved it so much that i came back and purchased the black for evenings with skinny jeans and heels. it's so soft and pretty  can be dressed up or down  and now i'm thinking about getting the wine color too! i *love* it. i washed it in cold/gentle and let it air dry and it held up fine. i wouldn't push it though. treat it delicately. it's a smar,2
This is the 2nd time i've purchased a dolan top and returned it b/c it was dry clean only. both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans  running errands  etc. i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt. it is made out of rayon  and that's the problem i think.  i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color  hangs nicely  doesn't cling. the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that -- i just pushed them up. as a turtleneck  it was a bit l,1
I have been on the hunt for a replacement cargo jacket for about a year now. i thought this one was going to be it!! ordered it right away. i got it in an xl as retailer coats always seem to run small on me (i am very busty so sometimes the more fitted styles won't even close without a big gap). this is not the case with this jacket. it runs really big - it looks like it could be an xxxl...but the design is great with a zipper and button closures  pockets and cute back cut...the color is slightly,2
"Bought the blue romper and love it to bits! definitely a summer staple. i'm 5'4""  105 lbs and generally consider myself proportioned  but curvy on the bottom  and the xs fit perfectly. many rompers have really short inseams  but this one is a relatively conservative 4-5"" so i feel comfortable and can dress it up or down. i've worn it a few times and received tons of compliments. it's super comfortable  forgiving  and flattering. i originally purchased it in black in pxs and ps  because at the ti",2
Nice lines  just a bit tight if you have larger / more muscley shoulders.,2
I picked this dress up in a size 8 - fits tts. i have a 34dd chest; 145 lbs. and 5 ft. 4 inches in height. i have an hourglass figure and the size 10 was too big and the 8 fit just right. the skirt is lined and the upper bodice part is not  it says on the tag hand wash which is a plus because dry cleaning is not a plus. hits me just about 2 inches above the knee. the thick lace detailing is very special and price point with the dress promo made me feel this would be a great dress for the holiday,2
I usually wear a small  sometimes and extra small  so when i ordered this skirt in a small  i wasn't worried. when it arrived  there is no stretch whatsoever and i'd have to wear it really it high in order to zip it. not necessarily a bad look but it is a little uncomfortable (no give  stiff material). it is really pretty  bright color and the eyelets and slit are unique. might try the next size up.,2
"Love  love  love!  this is true retailer! the color is lovely and it's so soft! i love the seams in the back and the overall ""raw seam"" style.",2
I tried this on in the store and decided to order a larger size online. the fabric by the buttons is very thin so any pulling will cause tears the one i tried on in store was shredded by someone else trying it. i'm a 34 dd and bought a 14. before trying it on i noticed the fabric is already pulling a little right out of the package. trying to decide if it is worth keeping or will be destroyed from wearing.   it really is very cute on.,1
Just purchased this on sale. will be perfect for summer on those days you wear dresses and don't want your skin to touch the subway bench! love it!,2
I am 5'4  so i feel i'm on the cusp of petite/regular sizing. i ordered 2p  (about 125-130lbs)  and the dress fit perfectly. it's so pretty (i got blue)  i ordered this for my upcoming trip for our anniversary...i feel like i can wear with sandals or heels  with leggings or no leggings. beautifully made. kind of pricey  but worth it.,2
I loved this top... the color is true to screen. the cut is cute. it's a lovely basic top that has just the right twist to it. i loved the fabric. it is see-through but if you wear a nude colored bra under it nothing shows.,2
Was surprised by the cute factor and great fit. the fabric is soft  it flows perfectly and isn't too long. it covers my rear. no gapping at the chest and i'm large busted. i got a large. the shirt is black and the florals in the pattern are a soft muted white. those little balls are small and more noticeable from the back. looks great under a jean jacket!,2
I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller.  it runs very generous  and so the sizing is a little off.  the style and quality are beautiful  so i am anxious to receive the smaller size.,2
I have worn this dress twice and it is amazing. the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it. i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it. i am 5'1 130 lbs and 34 d. i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly. i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone. definitely one of the best things i've ever bought from retailer.,2
For me  the v was too deep on this one  but the colors are beautiful.,2
I wanted to love this dress  it looks beautiful on the model but it isn't the flattering  even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it  it it runs pretty big.,1
This top is beautiful  however it runs beyond big!  i ordered my usual size and i could have fit 2 of me in this top.  i am reordering and going 2 sizes down!  the tie back and embroidery is beautiful.,2
Great top for the older woman who wants to be stylish but needs a little extra room. the subtle color goes with anything. i love it!!,2
I thought this top was absolutely beautiful online  and it doesn't disappoint in person. the fabric is divine  and i just love the paisley design. after putting it on though  it did look just a tad boxy  but not enough to return it. i would definitely recommend the top  and maybe a cute belt to accompany!,2
There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.,1
I tried on the xs in store i typically need petite) and it was a great length for me  i think petite would be too short for me to wear to work. the xs was a little snug on the waist  but the rest of the skirt fit perfectly  so though it was snug  i think i would still buy the xs. (stretchy band). the cream color/ivory is a nice summery color  not see-through unless you have dark unders. flirty and overall nice and airy for warm summer days. 115 lbs  26-27 inches waist),2
I read the online reviews that the dress ran large so ordered size 6 and 8. i'm normally an 8 or 10  and the 6 fit perfectly. dress hangs beautifully and lining is really soft. appears that it will wrinkle somewhat easily but i am keeping it anyway since it's so beautiful. the bell sleeves are really cute! i highly recommend the dress.,2
This is an awesome bra! it has a reinforced cup underneath (although not an underwire)  which i like. i was a little worried that it'd be huge  as i'm on the smaller side of the natori 36b in other bras  but it fits well and seems like it would accommodate b or c cup ladies. the lace is pretty and it is well made. i want more colors!,2
"I sized up to a medium from a small and was glad i did. the top drapes nicely and the fabric is soft.     5'7"" 140 lb 32 b  usually a small on top.",2
After reading the reviews  i was hesitant to purchase  but glad i did. i'm usually an xs or s depending on the brand  but i got this in a xxs. it fits perfectly and is so cute. does not look like a bathrobe at all. i love it because it's almost like a cardigan blazer...looks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan!,2
When i saw these lounge pants  i felt as though they were designed specifically for me. i love the cute bird design. i love the green/blue color of the fabric. the material is soft and inviting. give them a try. you won't regret it!,2
The reviews are right about these fitting perfectly in the fitting room  i knew right off i had to get them. i have a flat rear end and these make my rear look great! i'm 5'5 about 130 lbs. and i chose the 29. i initially bought both the 28 and 29' to make sure they would not stretch out and the didn't. i didn't want to be squeezed in with the 28. i think they are very well made and i'll love wearing them for a long time.,2
I bought this in white at my local store. great staple to wear in the heat of the summer or as a layering piece. i bought my normal size medium and it fits loose and flowy. i wore a nude racer back bra and felt comfortable without a cami. great basic addition to my closet.,2
"So so cute. i am 5' 7"" 150-155lbs and the 10 fit me perfectly. i expected the m or 10 to be too small. wore them the first day i received them. i have a large waist 34"". hips about 39"" and the 10 fits great  not tight. love the material and the workmanship is tops. i think they are a great buy especially on sale. wore them with a hei hei jacket also on sale  can't get much better.",2
First  my husband had to help me zip up in this interesting but awkward design. the materials is nice  but stiff  so the skirt is quite full. the shoulder idea is interesting  but i would not want to spend an evening in it. to me  not up to the usual ms standard.,1
This jacket was a little shorter than i had expected  but i still really enjoy the cut and fit of it.,2
Just received these this morning and so happy. cartonnier always makes a substantial quality product. might run a little large depends how roomy you want them  lovely colors and perfect length. wish they came in other colors.,2
This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom  the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!,2
I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly  i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short  for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist  for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful  for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look  and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c,0
I bought one size up in these fun cropped pants. i am petite but wanted these to fit longer  so i ordered a regular size. they are perfect. there is a nice patterned texture to these pants that is hard to see in the pictures. they are worth the price!,2
This dress is so pretty and the fabric is tightly woven so that it won't stretch as much as other sweater dresses. i am disappointed in the sleeves though. the cut is way below the armpit so that when you raise your arms  it pulls tight and is uncomfortable. for the price  and the amount of time i wanted to wear it  it's not worth keeping. another thing is that the fabric is tightly woven so if you are cold natured and ok with the sleeve issue  this is the dress for you. however  if you are hot,1
This dress is sweatshirt material and a lovely soft grey aqua color. i purchased a medium and it is an inch above my knee...ii am so tired of seeing woman my age and much younger in jeans...i am wearing this to a cooking class and it is perfect because it is so comfortable.....it is a great replacement for jeans!!!!!!!,2
"I read some of the other reviews and was surprised about comments that the color was off... i thought they were pretty dead on. i absolutely love this jacket  but do agree that it's more of a sweater-coat than a heavy coat you'd wear in the winter. but  i live in california  so this will be just perfect for our winter. i was afraid it might be too ""classic"" and uptight looking... but it's so fun! the bell sleeves add some extra flair. the overall coat has some stretch to it as well... making it",2
"I love wearing a dress at thanksgiving but don't want to be too dressy. this was perfect;: casual with a bit of sass and comfortable. it's also arm enough and super cute with booties. i'm 5'4"" and small boned. the xs fit perfect.",2
There's no doubt that this tee is sheer. i found that a nude bra is sufficient in overcoming the issue. the fit is true to size  with just enough room for drape without being too oversized. the beachy theme will be perfect come warm weather!,2
This dress is so cute! will you be bringing it back retailer?,2
I ordered both colors in the xxs p knowing that size goes fast. i used to wear xs or xs petite consistently  but this last year  i have found myself needing the smaller size (vanity sizing?) in this case  the xxs p was perfect for me  length was around mid-thigh (could almost wear as a dress if i were younger and not as muscular in my thighs)  the waist and chest are fitted but not snug (fitted in the sense that it follows my natural curves). the flower patterns are so cute  it does cut at the p,2
This cardigan is nice and the lace at the back is pretty. just be aware that it's definitely a cropped length  which is good for wearing over a dress that you don't want to cover up too much. size up if you want room to layer. the one i tried on at the store had the top button almost falling off  so i didn't buy it.,2
I love this dress. the quality of the material is very nice - good weight and softness. the dress hides my baby belly and feels really comfortable on. i got tons of compliments when i wore it!,2
This top is absolutely gorgeous in person. i am usually a size 12 in everything..pants and tops but this one i ended up getting a size 10. definitely size down otherwise the top will slide back on you and the arm holes will be crazy big. but it's a great top for summer. very cool and light. and the v-neck back and front is just so pretty. great buy!,2
This was my absolute favorite top before it transferred dye onto the driver's seat in my car. >:-( there is nothing in the language of the care tag which advises to wash before wearing because of the possibility of dye transfer to other surfaces. the care instructions say that is is washable with like colors and  in fact  recommends dry cleaning. really? and dry cleaning will remove all of that excess dye? don't think so. after i discovered the dye transfer on my car seat  i washed the top in a,1
Shoulders hide bra straps well - relaxed  but flattering fit. comfy  but can be dressed up!,2
"I love tracy reese. this skirt did not disappoint. i saw it originally in store & fell in love. i waited to see if it would go on sale... and it did!  i put on the size 12 & it fit gorgeously. the fabric is a bit stiff and bulky- but i think that's so it holds its shape. first thing i went into my living room & began twirling around.  i am 5'5"" 150lbs. athletic build. the sizing is true to tracy reese. i'll need to get the skirt hemmed as it's quite long on me. but- this little gem will be worn",2
This skirt is really cute. it's body conscious but not tight. the material is soft and stretchy  making it flattering and comfy. while it's smooth in the back  the draping in the front could hide tummy issues. as another reviewer said  you can dress this skirt up or down. i typically wear a s/4 in bottoms at retailer and the s fit tts. also  i love the different take on the high-low hem.,2
I bought two of these in xs. i am 5'11 and 150lbs. i started with the size small but that was to big  so down to a size xs and that was perfect. the color ivory/white is really nice  is not see through (i wear nude bras) and it goes with everything. i also didn't see any loose strings falling out of it like another reviewer said...quality material. the burnt orange is really nice too  perfect for fall. love the pockets. just make sure you size down one or two. i am usually a size medium to a lar,2
This is a beautiful top if you size way down. i normally wear a small in tiny tops. i had to buy an xxs petite in this top. even still there is a little extra material around the sides  but i've received a ton of compliments on the top.,2
I recommend this dress because it is beautiful  stylish and well made even though it did not work for me. i tried the small and extra small. the first - way too big  lengthwise (hit my knees) as well as in the shoulders - the latter to tight across the chest - not for me but worth a try. i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length.,2
Other reviewers have pointed out that these tops (i have both colors now  spoilers!) run long- and i am happy to agree. basically  there's a lot to work with here. i'm always looking for longer tops to traverse a larger bust  and this is a great hip-hitting length for me. plus  the neckline can be style multiple ways. all in all  a flattering better-than-basic sweater.,2
This is a beautiful blouse but it's gigantic. my bra size is 34d and i was swimming in a 2. the bust measured 42 inches at it's widest point. you can see the model is camouflaging the volume by holding her arms to the side. the fabric is pulled in an unatural way so the top is probably pinned for the photo. if you want this look go down 2 sizes. that much fabric is just not flattering on me so i am returning to the store. i'm passing on the 0 because the thin fabric seems like it will seriously,1
I love this dress. i'm 6' so it's a tad bit shorter than what shows on the model. it stops right at my ankles  which i'm okay with. it's a heavier fabric so it's maybe not good for those really hot  humid days. all-in-all it is super flattering on my hourglass figure. for reference  i'm a 38dd and normally wear a large in dresses at retailer. i ordered the large.,2
I love the color  the fabric and the style (especially in the model shots) but in reality  the cut is disproportionate. the hips and hip pockets flare out creating a saddlebag look. it is not smooth and fitted as shown on the model. overall you need to size down since i could pullover the dress without unzipping. i think the felted boiled wool is great quality but a tiny bit itchy. i still recommend the dress because i will be wearing it with a long sweater coat which will hide the weird hip act,2
This dress is lovely (albeit darker than it appears on the website)  but i had to return. it runs way small?i usually comfortably where an l or xl in maeve (this brand)  and could not even get this l on. would really only recommend for xs or s ladies (maybe m) who have the possibility of going larger. if you do purchase  absolutely size up 1-2 sizes.,1
"I love this top. it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips. the fabric and swing to the ""skirt"" is adorable.",2
This is a great easy to wear summer dress. a denim jacket would look adorable to wear on a cooler night. it runs a bit small in the waist and i bought the petite because i wanted it to be above the knee summer casual. it is very flattering because of the pattern detail by the waist. it is the perfect summer dress and best of all it is machine washable!,2
I got the moss color in this cardigan. i'm not sure why these aren't sold out because it is pretty amazing! it is super soft and is a cute addition to a casual outfit. i would say that for this price it's definitely worth the buy!,2
I had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim  and these crops were made specifically for petites. also  i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean  not a skinny. the fit and sizing seems to be a little off. i ordered my regular size in this brand  27p  but they were too big. sized down to a 26p. they were still too large in the waist (seemed very stretchy) but fit well in the legs. i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect ,2
I like the fabric and aesthetic of this top  and really wanted to like it  however i wish it were longer. i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes  but even the medium felt short and clingy. however that might be because i'm curvy with a long torso  so i'd definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online!,2
I am always looking for a nice denim skirt and this one is great the pale pink is perfect and the stretch is awesome. i wore wedges with it and a nice romantic top and it looked great. i originally got a 8 and a 10 and kept the 8 because of the stretch it fit perfectly. nice length and great quality,2
Loved the design and print of this blouse.  however  every time i put it on or took it off  i could hear the seams ripping.  definitely wasn't because it was too small either.,1
Unique and well-made skirt  sure to turn heads.  embroidery is lovely.  def a statement piece for any wardrobe.,2
I usually find maeve to run tts  but i sized down in this. i am normally a 6p and got an xs regular (to make the length more work-appropriate). i think a larger size emphasized the extra room at the front tucks - making it look a little maternity-like.  it is very flattering on - drapes nicely. i got the cranberry color for the holidays and will wear in with wine tights and light taupe over the knee suede boots!,2
This dress is breathtaking! it is super lightweight and will be the perfect addition to my suitcase for summer travels! can be dressed up or down with jewelry & heels.,2
I was so excited to get the dress  it's extremely beautiful and comfortable. the size i picked was unfortunately too big for me though  i just had a baby so it's hard to figure out what size i am now..details were exquisite.,2
Very cute and comfortable! can be wear with tights and boots or into spring with flags! very flattering fit for someone with smaller upper body them bottom half!!,2
Absolutely adore the simplicity and style of this dress. dress is quite flowy  the fabric under the pleats is very soft making is quite comfortable.,2
This is a really nice dress for the money. i definitely had to size down. i've always taken a 4 in hd in paris tops  so i initially ordered a 4. but it was a little too big in the chest area. (i wear a 32dd so normally this isn't my issue.) i replaced it with a 2 and it fits great. i also have a long torso  which can be an issue for me with dresses. but this one works on me! this is definitely a good dress for taller girls. the material is high quality too. i'm going to wear it to my friend's we,2
I'm 5'8 140 lbs and small worked perfectly. great dress!,2
Wear the collar down & it favors grace kelly. pull it up and it's an oversized hood. this lightweight cozy piece combines everything i love about a sweater & a coat in one.,2
I tried this on in the navy/white combination and loved it  except it is cut rather full or large through the waist especially. if you can size it down so it fits you  you will love it. it is very soft; an easy top to throw on  feel comfy  and look fantastic! i sure wish it was smaller :/,2
These pants lived up to expectations. the fabric is very soft and did not wrinkle in the dryer. i am normally not a big fan of cropped styles but love that these have the gathered leg and can be styled dressier or casual. i thought the cargo pockets might stick out too much but they lay nicely. i feel i will get a lot of use from these and the best part is they are not constrictive and they are super comfy.,2
This skirt caught my eye immediately. i love the beautiful patterns and colors. i'm currently pairing it with a charcoal grey top  which works well. the only slight concern is the material is a little poofy. i still love it  and definitely recommend this standout piece.,2
I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.,1
"I love the embroidery detailing on the top. i think this shirt looks better in person than online.    i'm an hourglass shape  and this loose style for shirts often tents out away from my chest  but this top drapes down nicely. however  loose shirts like this aren't my style  so i belt this at my waist  and it looks even better. the top flatters my broad shoulders (meaning that it doesn't make them look wider)  and it hits below my hips (i'm 5'10""). i also appreciate that the armholes are small ",2
This is a lovely blouse. i think is a bit roomy  but even so  i like the look. i have to dress business casual for work and this blouse fits the bill as it's not too casual.,2
Too pricey for the quality of this imported product.,0
This dress is very comfortable  very flattering and just lovely. my only critique is that the skirt is more rust colored in real life  where on the website it looks more red. and the bodice looked a bit more peach/pink in the picture. still a beautiful  interesting  well made and extremely comfortable dress. thanks retailer! i am 5'9  155# and the m is great.,2
These truly are tights and not leggings. they could not be worn alone but definitely great under skirts or dresses. they are thick and warm. i thought they ran a little big.,2
I was initially drawn to the shade of blue that these were as i was looking for a lighter late summer denim. after trying them on  i found that i did not want to take them off. they fit well and did not squeeze me anywhere. no muffin top as another reviewer noted. they are definitely a looser fit so size down. i probably could have even sized down again because i found them to stretch out after a while leaving a less flattering fit but certainly still s comfortable wear. absolutely worth a try!!,2
I really love the idea behind this. however  the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops  and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.,1
This top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure. i have 36ddd boobs and a muscular  curvy frame. this top adds about 20lbs.,0
Gorgeous design  but it was just so heavy. i felt overwhelmed by the amount of fabric  although this is my fault for thinking i could get by in regular sizing as petite was sold out. will be returning,1
I ordered this on-line  in a size 8. the fit is ample and fine fine  and the fabric is acceptable  but as much as i wanted to like it  and keep it  i ultimately returned it. it is just too  too conservative for me. i loved the deep olive/khaki colour  and even experimented wearing it open as a duster over a top and slip pants  leggings  or skinny jeans  but the collar and the front pocket styling are just too man-tailored and cargo-like in their styling for me. i tried it with different belts  w,2
This is a very soft and feminine chemise. it is a little more see thru than i had anticipated  but i still love it!,2
I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however  upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly. and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.,0
Cute shirt  it looked big so i ordered a size smaller. worked fine. would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down. ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back. fun shirt though!,1
Flattering poncho  pair well with leggings or skinny jeans and booties,2
This sweater is beautiful but runs large all over. i ordered a m and returning for a small. hopefully that works.,2
Absolutely love this dress. i saw it online and didn't give it much thought and then saw it in the store and it was amazing. the photos really do not do it justice. the embroarding detail at the bottom is beyond beautiful in person. i agree that if you don't want skin showing you will need a black bra or black cami to over the delegate lace down the front and back of the dress. got this for fall/winter in fl and cannot wait to wear it  perfect holiday party dress!,2
Very small! so disappointed! they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived!,1
"I love the peplum tanks that retailer puts out  but sadly this one did not work for me. the print is vibrant and the colors are even brighter in person  the the material made it look cheap. the fit in the bust was off - i felt that it cut too much into the bra area. and the poof part of the peplum hit me at a weird spot on my torso. really wanted it to work  but maybe it would look better on someone more slender/taller than me (for reference i'm 4'10"" and usually wear size l in retailer)",1
This dress is amazing. i bought it for an afternoon wedding i'm attending  it's perfect! it fits like a glove and the lace is so delicate. the nude sheath really allows the lace and all the details to stand out. love it in the black!,2
Well fitted kinda slouchy sweater. matches photo and product description. looking forward to cooler temps!,2
I ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed. as other reviewers have mentioned  the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures. the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person.   as for sizing  i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers' comments about it running small. the 2p fit me fine  although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested #32b#. i can definitely see that being an issue,1
Great style!,2
Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.,2
I also agree with the other reviewers that it's important to try on a couple due to pattern differences. this dress has a beige base- the photo is a little misleading. i ended up returning it because the colors didn't do much for me  i think they look great on the model but that's because the beige doesn't blend into her at all. i also think it's a little overpriced for what the dress is- a great summer day dress.,2
This blouse is gorgeous on i purchased at my local store i noticed it was $29.99 + 30% = $21.00 omg it's so nice on it's soft and comfortable and the gold threading make it sunning it does run a little small in the chest area,2
This silk skirt was not the best look for me  but may work for others. i purchased the med  which fit fine. i just wasn't in love with the print/colors. the skirt has quality material and is well made. it's very light and airy. i did return it.,2
I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding. it is absolutely gorgeous! the actual fabric is much more detailed in person. sizing is accurate. the dress is knee length. there is a little tulle underneath to give it the a-line shape.,2
I got this skirt because its elegant and can be worn in three seasons. it is stylish and can easily be dressed up or down. i usually wear an xs in bottoms and this runs about one size large in the waist area. still  i am keeping it and plan to have it altered. it is cute and completely worth the extra effort,2
I tried this on in the store  and the fabric is lovely - so  so soft and drapey. the skirt is very flattering - good length. but the zipper! the zipper was already ripped away from the fabric  so i wasn't able to purchase it. such a shame.,0
I purchased this dress for my graduation. the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online. i'm kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent. i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress. the fabric is 100% synthetic.the fit is great. the dress is true to size,1
I bought this late in the season and love the way it fits and looks.,2
The fabric is beautiful  the embroidery quite striking  and the length is perfect. however  the dress is a bit amorphous; and as others have mentioned  the sleeves are silly. so i took the dress to my favorite seamstress  and she added a couple of darts in the back and fixed the sleeves - voila!. these weren't expensive fixes  and now the dress is perfect.,2
I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a 2 and because of the stretch in it  it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.,2
Top is completely see through. i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like. it is a cute design but not practical at all.,0
I love all paige denim. i have the flared which i purchased in july and now the skinny. i got the zara ones last year which are a copy obviously and they are just not the same. the ones last year the paige sierra sold out fast but luckily these are here. i actually like these more because they are more worn looking. you can even wear a pretty top underneath to enhance them.,2
The pictures don't do this cardi justice. it's so lovely and ladylike. it's seems very well made. please can we have more from this designer??,2
These leggings are very comfortable and cute. only reason they are not 5 stars is because the pattern is not quite as vibrant as i was expecting.,2
This dress is much larger in person than it looks on the model but i absolutley love it! there is an inner tie that helps taper the waist a bit and the material is gorgeous!,2
I absolutely love this dress. i am 5'0 and 167 pounds and the extra large was way too big. the large was perfect. the fabric is substantial but the fit is loose and swingy so it is good for the atlanta heat and humidity. i want to wear this every day.,2
Beautiful bohemian maxi that feels like soft woven cotton/poly but it's unfortunately viscose. the print is as vibrant & detailed as expected from hemant & nandita. color contrast not as bright irl. body of dress flares out to an a-line after the arm holes and the hem is a shark bite to show off your footwear. there is no lining  but it doesn't seem see through. very relaxed fit that feels tts but if you prefer a slimmer cut and are of slender body habitus  size down. otherwise  if you are busty,1
"I am very frustrated. i ordered the pxs and pxxs back in may...at the time they were both on back order until early august. last week i received an email that the pxxs was no longer available. i emailed customer service and got the reply that the shipment of pxxs was damaged and so that's why they were no longer available. i did receive the pxs and while the length is good for me at 5'4"" it is enormous through the entire body (shoulders down to the hemline!) i know the pxxs is the size i needed",0
At first  i thought this top was going to be stiff. i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is. it's lovely cream color with beautiful lace details. i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go bra-less when it's hot! i'm 5'2''  135lb and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body. but i feel this top is slight short on me. that might be because i didn't wear it off-the-shoulder but had it hang from the top of,2
I bought this to wear for my baby shower at 34 weeks. i was able to buy it in my size and still get a great fit  and the skirt hits right at my bump with the band just above it. great option for expecting mothers that can be worn after baby  the top is also snug enough to feel like it covers properly (could be too snug if you are large chested though).,2
Skirt has lots of stretch and comes up to waistline so i am not sure yet how i will wear it but tucked in or out it looks very stylish and the dark denim is of course slimming.,2
Beautiful warm vest. originally bought small but had to exchange for extra small. i love that it reversible and has a hood.,2
This is much cuter in person than in the picture. in person  i am much more aware that it is also a lower length in the back and it flairs just a little so that the design really stands out. i bought in the white and blue dots and can see wearing it in the now  spring  and even summer! it is just a tad tight in my size 10  so i went up to a 12. thank you retailer - this will be timeless!!,2
"I ordered this shirt in each color and different sizes: petite  regular  ""my"" size  a size up and one down!  verdict: i ended up in regular size  not petite because i felt the petite was jsut that short and i could feel te cold breeze in the store. i could have gone in the 00  0  and 2 #2 is my usual size#  but ended up in a 0 only because it was less wide on me. it is  hwoevcer a tiny bit tighter around the back if i cross my arms forward #really  i don't do that move on a daily basis#. colr: i",2
Love  love  love these leggings! a soft  colorful  comfortable way to show your artistic flare.,2
This top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly.,1
Due to the black sheath being out of stock in all sizes (for quite some time)  i took my chances ordering an 8p in navy which was way too big on me. i also didnt love the navy. i wish i could try the 6 or 6p in black but out of stock and wouldn't arrive in time for my events. sadly returning.,1
"I haven't owned a skort in years! this one is super cute and so soft! i love the details  the asymmetrical cut and the buckles. i bought it in olive green. it fits really well. i'm 5'5"" 119 lbs with an athletic frame and i purchased a size 2 (my normal size). it fits comfortably around my waste and thighs/but with some wiggle room.     i'm wearing it today w/ a navy blue/cream floral tank top  white/navy striped vans  and a gold dangly necklace. i love that its a versatile item and i'm looking f",2
I bought this top for my mom for christmas. i wasn't sure if she would like it  but it is really nice in person and she loved it. it fit true to size and can be dressed down  as it is on the model  or dressed up. i am so glad i decided to get this top. highly recommend.,2
It's a bit baggy (i'm normally a 6/8 medium but went with the small here). i debated for a while but finally went for it on sale and i'm so glad. the colors are just gorgeous in person. delicate stitching on the shoulders adds a feminine touch. great with my jean jacket which gathers up the extra material just right. looks great with summer sandals and booties for fall. i love love love this dress!,2
"I tried this on in the store and it fit like a tent on me. it doesn't help that i'm 5'1"" and the store didn't have the petite sizes. maybe on a teller person it would work better. or maybe if i had been able to try the petite size it would have more wearable. it is a comfy style and the natural fiber is a plus. i have another holding horses dress that i love which also runs large. i did not mark this as ""runs large"" because the sleeves are more true to size while the bodice is very billowy. i wo",2
I ordered this sweater online in a size xs and the order was cancelled because it was out of stock. i ended up finding a sm at my local retailer and was so happy! it worked just perfectly. i'm usually an xs but the sm worked great. it is a thick knit and may snag so i'm being careful with it. simply meant to be:),2
This jumper is adorable and very well made! it is a bit tight in the ankles and it kind of gives me a hungry bum look but then i realized i ordered a 4p so it is actually tts. going to preview this number at my bachelorette party!,2
This top is too short  so much so that tucking it in would be difficult. the designs are lovely  but the short length is putting this top back on the rack.,1
It's a cute idea  but it's so low cut and the material is very thin. i was hoping to wear it as a cool  flowing summer top  but i'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it. i'm only keeping it because it was such a good price. also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten.,1
I wanted to love these pants since i hate super-fitted skinny pants. but they are really oversized. i'm 125lbs and 5 foot 2. so i'm petite but not considered skinny and have well endowed thighs and legs.but the xs was way too big for me.,0
"Like the first reviewer  i love the color and look  and agree that it is much longer and wider than it looks in the photo. i am 5'3"" 116lb and ordered a small. i was planning to wear it tucked into palazzo pants as the model seems to have done  but they must have used some other way to gather up the sweater in back because there is no way such volumes of material can be tucked into anything. and the metallic threads are itchy  so i had to finally layer a full sleeve tee under it to be able to st",2
This skirt is absolutely beautiful. the design and organza are so feminine  and i love the length. it flows beautifully and it isn't stiff or anything  but it does hold its shape well. i ordered it through the store  and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days. i think it would be easy to snag the material  so i will be really careful when i'm wearing it. the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt  and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu,2
I got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it. it's soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together.  i initially sized up to a 10 based on other reviews but exchanged it for an 8  my normal size. it's flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric. in the 8 it's just right for the style.,2
I love jumpsuits in general. however  it is usually either a yay or a nay and this was definitely a yay! i am currently wearing it right now as i write this review! the waistband hits perfectly on me. i am 5'7 and about 160 and i bought the large. super easy to throw on!,2
This dress is comfortable and a great go to dress to wear to work and then after for drinks with friends.,2
I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very  very stiff. i was expecting something silky  or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case  it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice  but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o,1
Great as a beach coverup. i paired it with a slip underneath and a belt and it looks amazing! can't wait to wear it on the beaches of the bahamas soon!,2
I purchased the mango. it is flattering with my olive skin and golden brown hair. i am keeping it. i'm used to linen so no surprises there. i agree with a reviewer that said it will work in summer and fall. i could wear this walking on the beach  to a summer casual dinner party. i plan on wearing gold sandals and gold jewelry. this will make the feel more summertime. then i will wear boots with it in the fall. i'm very happy with the choice. my store didn't have the blue. the fit is tts. i'm 5 f,2
I was very excited to find this jumper in a store to try on. the small was huge (im 5'8  130lbs)  the xs was better but perhaps a bit short in the upper body  making it feel tight/stretched against my shoulders. i love the print and style  and would have bought it if it was $100 less. however  at the current price  it needs to fit perfectly  which sadly it did not.,1
I'm a stay at home mom  always on the lookout for something casual  interesting  yet put together. it's preppy yet quirky with the embroidery. i love this shirt. great with jeans  can take you from shopping to playground and lunch without feeling under or overdressed anywhere. the sparkle from the embroidered birds gives it spunk to not make it look too boring and predictable. at the same time  it isn't something that screams  look at me! a perfect mix.,2
I immediatley bought this adorable dress after trying it on at my local retailer and absolutely love it! it fits tts for me in my regular size small (34d-27-35) and it's incredibly soft and comfortable to wear. the top portion is so great as it has nice short sleeves  the color is a nice deep  rich orange which looks great now in the summer but will look especially cute in the fall with tall boots and a light denim jacket plus the bottom half is cut in such an interesting way. the material is amaz,2
Gorgeous details great use of materials -- yet the diagonal seam above the knee at the quadriceps cuts off the muscle and looks odd if you are the least bit muscular.,2
I bought this t-shirt in three colors and i'm keeping them because they work for what i want (travel clothes) but the t-shirts run big and are too boxy. i think they look nice if you tuck them in.,2
These were so perfect for the first hour or so. i was convinced they were my new favorite pants! but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch  and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after i'd been sitting a couple hours. it looked downright embarrassing - saggy and wrinkly (radiating from the crotch  no less) . i got them in the gray  and it's possible that other colors use different  less awful fabric.,1
"This was a rare full-price purchase for me. i do think that it runs slightly large  but that is part of the ""look"" of this dress. i considered sizing down to an xs for more definition at the waist  but they didn't have one in store so i decided to stick with my regular s. i look forward to wearing this with sandals while summer is still sweltering  but i also think it will transition well with tights  boots  and a cardigan when temps start cooling off.",2
Beautiful dress. not lined  but the fabric is sturdy enough. i do prefer a slip under but that is my preference for most things. great for dressing up or down. so comfortable.,2
This is a beautiful piece - but not if you need a hardy sweater. the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw. but it is lightweight and delicate. i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly. i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness  i had to say no. i will watch for sale.,2
This is a beautiful  artistic piece for your wardrobe! seriously  rosie neira is a talented  london-based designer  who will thrill you with her vision. she is expert at making a woman look amazing from every direction; these knits are stunning  the materials and workmanship flawless. the medium fits me as expected (size 8  medium top  34f). i was drawn to this by the rosie neira label  the flowing front drape and slightly longer back  the gorgeous knit quality and design  and the way it makes m,2
"This sweater is absolutely gorgeous! the green is a lovely  rich shade and the material is wonderfully soft. i love the slightly slouchy fit  but it's far from looking shapeless. i bought my usual size small (5'8""  140  straight athletic build  size 4/6) and i love it casually paired with boyfriend jeans and ankle boots or a little elevated with a skinny and heels.  i'm so happy to have tracked it down in our local store  i'd buy them all if there was more in stock!",2
Cozy slouchy sweater. very versatile. fits tts  just as shown on model.,2
This is an absolutely beautiful dress  but arrived with several holes in it!,1
Cute top and flattering to wear. fits nicely and i'd say true to size. can't wait to wear it.,2
These shirts are fantastic; lightweight sleeves for summer wear. i go back and forth between xs and small  (i have broad shoulders) and ordered one of each. i like both. the shirt has give so the xs is fine but the variation in size gives the two shirts very different looks.    the color is fantastic and true to the photos! not always the case with online purchasing so i loved that.,2
These have become my go-to shorts as i can dress them up or down,2
The rose color is lighter than the photo of the model in front of the pink building  but on the other photos it does look lighter so i wasn't surprised.  my dress fits very nicely. i love the drop waist  the loose fit at the hips  and the flare of the ruffles.  the back is just like the model too. i thought it may be boxy but it comes in at the waist and goes a-line. perfect. i ordered the xl because it wanted it to be loose like on the model.  i was afraid because of my large dd chest it would,2
I'm a size xl and i'm busty  so my review might not apply to everyone.  .  i really wanted this jacket to work  however  it did not. i tried this jacket on in my usual size xl and it was nowhere near the correct size. this jacket runs small. i don't see how anyone with a bust is going to be able to button this jacket. the jacket is not lined and it is very fitted  so putting the jacket on and taking it off will require a very thin shirt to be worn underneath.  .  the style of the jacket is very,1
Soft  comfortable  flattering - great for spring  summer  fall  and wear a tight black long-sleeved tee underneath for winter! not form-fitting  even if you size down.,2
I ordered my normal size 32. they were a little tight however i'm glad because they normally stretch out quite a bit so i'm assuming they should fit perfect after one wearing. the length is fine for my 5'9 height and they are very soft.. i'm so happy with the light red color  it's almost a rust which i love.,2
This dress is everything. i'm 5'4  athletic build  36d and the medium fit me perfectly. the colors are really understated and beautiful and can easily be dressed up or down. i wish the elastic around the waist fell a little lower but that's one of those things only i notice and definitely didn't keep me from falling in love and buying it. can't wait to wear it on vacation next week!,2
This is a pretty dress  but it runs at least one size too large. the silk is of good quality. it would be good for somebody who is slim and tall.,2
"This is my first ever jumpsuit purchase  and i love it! the retailer by me luckily had an xs in stock for me to try  and it fit perfectly (i'm 5'7""  120lbs  slim). looking at the pictures i was a little concerned the jumpsuit would be short  but the length actually hits me closer to my ankles (still a couple inches above). the jumpsuit feels nice and light and comfortable and not difficult to get in and out of. the embroidery detail on the shoulders is a nice touch and the print is fun. would defi",2
I love the black and grey version of the vest but decided too try it in plum. the plum color is used only on the lapels and inside of the garment. it has no finished seams but it is like a soft boiled wool so it wouldn't ravel. the seam in the waistline area breaks up the design and adds more interest.,2
I looked forward to this dress.  it's a lovely design.  it's a heavy material that doesn't have the most flattering fit.  the green lace has snags along the hemlines which is a disappointment.  i'm returning the dress.,1
Love this top! the material is very comfortable and it's loose fitting which is what i was looking for!,2
The heart version is very pretty  i can't speak for the striped one as i have not seen that one in person. i ordered the xxs after trying on the xs  as i felt the petite would be perhaps too short. the xs was a little big on me. the only problem with xxs regular is the sleeves are longer on me  like 3/4 length  not to elbow as shown on model. but i don't want the shirt to be too short so sticking with that size.    for reference  i am 115 lbs  30dd chest  26.5 in waist  and short.,2
I got size 26 and they don't fit me as ankle  they fit me as long skinnies  but the quality is so good. they're smooth and stretchy  but they feel thick enough that when you pull them on you can tell it's quality denim. a great pant buy if you're looking for soft as butter grey jeans.,2
Cute jacket  but size didn't work on me. 5'4  135 lbs. normally order s or xs in tops  but m in jackets. ordered the medium  but way too long everywhere. i can get by with regular a lot in retailer  but definitely ordering the petite to see if any better. not sure it will be enough though as arms were quite long.,2
Love this top! it's great for wearing with leggings. the material is soft and not too heavy. love the variation the zippers give you! i have in the moss and love it!,2
I love these jeans! they actually look better than the picture and you cannot beat the sale price. they are a boyfriend fit  but you can order your normal size. usually with boyfriends  i have to order one to two sizes down. with skinnies and more fitted jeans  i am a 29 and that's what i got. there is no sagging or stretching out after wearing them for a while. the wash is absolutely beautiful...very worn. hopefully the holes in the knees won't get even bigger. i have worn and washed them now q,2
This shirt is beautiful. it is flowy and light  a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring. however  do not follow the washing instructions on the tag. it says you can machine wash  tumble dry low  and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low  it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it. it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again. if you do order  please take the,1
I purchased the blue & white pattern of this shirt. the color blue was bright and contrasted perfectly with the white color in the square design. this shirt worn with a white pair of slacks or a white skirt makes a perfect presentation for any occassion during the warm spring and summer months. the fit of the shirt was true to size. i love the longer length of this shirt because it elongates one's height. the cuffed sleeves are perfect in length. the classic style of this shirt guarantees many y,2
"For a brand called ""tiny""--this dress was really big. i ordered my usual m and it was like a sack--virtually no shape to it at all. i haven't been a small in many decades  so i'm really hesitant to order it again. i'm afraid i'll be like goldilocks--""too big!""  ""too small!""--but i'm probably going to give it a whirl because the green print is so pretty  and i l like that it has sleeves to protect from sun. and pockets! lots of good qualities  just putting them together in a wearable size seems t",1
Beautiful dress that is very flattering! wearing it to my bridal shower.  more appropriate for spring or summer!,2
This is a throw it on and you're cute.  so easy and comfy  requires barely any styling to look cute in this.  and it has pockets!,2
The color of this t is beautiful and the shimmer is understated. very thin fabric  but should be fine.,2
In truth  it looks better in the photo. i am sure it was a great value for the money i spent. however  i am keeping it because it will match perfectly with a pair of satin pants i want to wear to holiday parties.,2
This is a really pretty top that you can dress up or down. the draping on the neck and shoulders falls nicely and i love the back with the lace. it is simple but unique and has nice classic lines. i am usually a pxs but based on the measurements i went with the regular xxs and glad i did bc the petite would have been too short.,2
In my opinion  the quality and uniqueness of this piece far definitely warrants a full price purchase. adorable cut and style  comfortable and cute. it's the perfect flexible top to wear to work with a skirt or more casually with your favorite pair of jeans. love this!,2
Wonderful sweater and fashionable for autumn. the only thing i do not like about the sweater is that it sheds very bad. bring a lint roller with you when you wear the sweater!,2
"I am beyond pleased with this dress. photos do not do it justice and no  it does not look like a gown. it is comfortable  forgiving  and will be a staple for years to come. i am 5' 11"" and the large worked perfectly for me in length and size. this is my first maxi dress and i'm thrilled. do not miss this piece  it is special!",2
The weight and drape of this shirt is wonderful. it is very comfortable while still being flattering. you could wear it with jeans and sneakers or heels. fits true to size and the navy color is very deep.,2
These coveralls are not cut long enough  i am long in the body and it is very hard for me to find coveralls overalls that are long enough and these unfortunately are the same. i have large breast so that adds to the problem so when i stand sideways and look at the waistband the front you can see is pulled up where the back is hanging lower. they really are nice  my first thought when i put them kn was wow i look a tad like michael myers in them but they're really very cool.....wish i could keep,2
"High quality fabric and lots of bottom/ back coverage. also  it did not cut into my hips (which is fabulous!) ...so  if you're looking for a little more coverage this is your bottom. i found it true to size...i'm 5'8"" and 150 lbs and i got a size 8 :)",2
It's a unique piece and feels very comfy for casual wear - lots of compliments.,2
I love this tee  i own it and wear it nearly every other day in black and purple solids and ordered 2 of the prints. wish that the purple/gray floral print would restock since it sold out before i could purchase it. only possible negative is that i am careful not to tumble dry it due to other reviews of its vulnerability to tears or holes. so i hang it up to dry after machine washing. i read that it runs a bit large so i ordered and am thrilled with my medium.,2
This brand makes the best jackets. i got a vest from them last year and an olive moto jacket. both fit amazing. this one is no different. it fits great!! love that it's a great casual jacket with structure and drape. i can't say enough good things about this jacket. every time i wear it  i feel so pulled together. fun light gray color that you don't see too often in jackets. this is a jacket i see in my wardrobe for years to come. must have.,2
I just received this dress tried it on. i totally fell in love with it . the pink is just beautiful.it's a little big so i will definitely will be exchanging it for a size 14 . you would absolutely love this dress.,2
Disappointed :-( this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it's going back.,0
I bought this today in navy and loved it the second i put it on. it feels great on  is well made and flattering! you can wear it anywhere and look pulled together. much cuter in real life too. it does run a little small. id go up a size if you're getting the white so it won't cling too much.,2
"I'm not sure why they call this ""black"" because what you see in this pictures depicted is pretty much the shade in person. the fabric itself is lovely. it made my wider hips look smaller! :)  ___________ pros: - drapes beautifully on the body  especially for curvier gals. - not black but a deep navy/velvet look and feel. - very forgiving and stretchy. - perfect length in front and back. - hides imperfections wonderfully. - soft  flows well  and unique!  cons: - material is thin  not for winter a",2
It is delightful  dreamy and yes it is quite right. perfect fit  i wear a size 8 and it was right on!!!,2
Dear retailer & designers:  just want a nice dress that isn't made from polyester! don't mind paying bigger bucks for quality fabrics  but please- enough of the polyester!   love   your customers,2
This dress is beautiful and delicate  so flattering! runs a little big- slightly looser fit- got the size small  usually a 6-8  and it is perfect. the slip included is very sheer however  so i am using a different black slip for mine.,2
The are so comfortable  flattering  and i feel i can wear them with a lot of styles: dress them up or down  it all looks good. great product! make more like this please!,2
"Contrary to the first review  i find this top to be gorgeous. the fabric has a silkiness to it (with a slightly heavier weight). the lace thru neckline is beautifully done (the eyelets are high-quality). the fit has flow  like on the model  but still a bit of shape (not the formless fit that some blouses like this have). i love the open sleeves. i am 5' 8"" 120lbs 34b and am happy with the xs.",2
I bought this in my usual size small.  it is really light and airy--very pretty.  as the other reviewer noted  it is longer in front and shorter in the back.  the back hit my waistband  as it does on the model in the picture.  it hid my bra very well (always a plus).  i wouldn't describe the fabric as soft and i did get a static electricity issue  but the top stayed put.  overall  very pleased.,2
The prints are subtle  the fabric is soft  and the mismatched buttons are cute. unfortunately  even in an xs  it was huge all over. i love flowy shirts and swing styles  but this just stuck way out from my body and was unflattering.,1
Love it! the light blue is a gorgeous color. i thought this might be more chambray  but i'm happy it's not. it's also stitched at the top so no awkward accidental peep show or need for annoying tape.,2
"This dress is even more gorgeous in person! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store. i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years. i think i have finally found ""the one'! i should note i am 5'9"" and this dress goes all the way to my knees. it may swallow someone on the shorter side.",2
I was nervous about this dress due to the reviews saying it was odd and the colors being different. but these weren't issues for me. the color is navy. it has the loops at the sides of the dress to hold the belt on  but it also has a loop in the front center of the dress  which i think is nice  no one likes a limp bow ;) the belt is nothing to write home about  but it ties the dress together nicely. the front pocket is different  but i really like it. i had a hard time conceptualizing it before,2
I bought the top in an x-large because i normally wear a 12/14 and i was swimming in it. i unfortunately returned it but did eventually buy the large. it is a cute fit and a fun tee to have. the fabric is soft but a little excessive on the bottom.,2
I liked this top even though it was a definite 'swing' style. i ended up altering it to remove some of the fullness.  looks great with jeans as well as black pants for a dressier look. very soft and comfortable fabric. wish it was just a little bit longer.,2
I love  this dress. it is beautiful   feminine  and fits perfectly. i am a 4 in a dress size. i have long wait 5 7. . very happy in this simple yet unique dress.,2
Gorgeous dress  colors as appear in picture  thick material- quality is good. sizing- im usually a size 2 or small  got a small  and it is big in the chest/ length is below the knee. would recommend a size smaller than normal. not a huge deal- small alteration job.,2
"Really nice quality warm  sleek sweater. runs small-ish. i'm 5'8""  140 lbs  34c. i got the small and could have gotten x-small.",2
Love this tee. it has a drapery cut which i love. the only thing i found was that it ran a bit smaller.,2
Purchased dress in blue motif. love it. it is casual and comfortable  no fuss dress. love the sexy open scoop back that is just high enough to comfortably cover my bra strap.,2
"I purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it on-line and ordered it in my usual size petite 6 (i'm 5'4"" 34d-27-35) and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on. i immediately adored all the different prints on this one  the length  the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter. it's a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well. also ",2
This top is a nice color and soft material  but is much more of a swing top style than i was looking for. i will return it  but it could be ideal for someone who wants a very loose fitting casual look.,2
Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large  but lean towards xl when things don't have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn't squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn't want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far  i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos  the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he,0
"I love this dress. will be wearing it for the first time tomorrow. it fits well. the neck line is a bit low on me. i think it would look best on someone with more of a chest than i have. i will be wearing a winter white infinity scarf with it (as shown on model). i am 5' 6.5"" and 120 lbs and the small is just right.",2
Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.,1
I absolutely love this dress! the fit is great and the elastic waist helps to show off your shape. it's great for the warmer fall weather we have in the south  but i can put tights with it when it gets colder. the dress is thin  but not sheer so there's no need for a liner. i'm 5'8  weigh 144lbs and ordered this dress in a size 10. i think i might have been able to wear an 8  but the 10 fit so well that i kept it.,2
Cute top. not sure about the tassels at the sleeves. very flattering in the waist area.,2
I love this sweater! timeless--classical with an edge! i will have it until the end.,2
I love this poncho. it' so soft and cozy!! looks great with a pair of tights or jeans. just adorable.,2
"I tried it on and it fit like a glove. i'm only 5'2"" and i can wear with heals or flats. great built in bra. i'm a c cup and i've got a bubble butt. very flattering on my figure. quality worth every penny. many compliments. work appropriate or a luncheon! my fav retailer purchase by far.",2
"I am a huge fan of ag stevie ankles and own at least a dozen pair. i am 5'4""  so this style is perfect for me. this particular wash is a fantastic and flattering fit. it hits right above my ankle and fits beautifully through the hips and legs. i am going to buy a 2nd pair as i know i will be wearing these all the time!",2
I really wanted to love this top but the other reviewers are spot on when they say it is too short and boxy. so  fresh out of the package  the ruffle hit me right at the widest part of my hips and when i raised my arms the shirt exposed my midriff. not cute. i really liked the quality though so i washed it on delicate and then tugged gently to stretch the length out and hung to dry. now  it's still a wee boxy  of course  but significantly longer and much cuter on me. so  i'm keeping. even thinki,1
The only strange thing is the size. i used to wear size s (117bl) but this time the small is way too big. i still keep it and put a belt on. it is a very very pretty dress. i used to buy sale from antheropologie. but can not wait this time. i am very impressed by the design. can not praise more!,2
I tried this shirt on in store  and loved it! it has a flattering fit and is very comfortable. i read some other reviews about the quality not being good  i don't feel that way at all. the knit and the silky/satiny materials both feel like quality to me. the one concern i have is that it may wrinkle easily. i'm 5'4'' and 125lbs and the xs fits well. i plan to pair it with skinny jeans.,2
I bought these pants to wear while riding on the back of my husbands motorcycle. i wanted something that was more chic than typical motorcycle women's clothing and these were perfect. they block the wind but are stretchy on the back side so they are super comfortable to wear all day. i also wear these to work on fridays! i bought a size 28 and they fit great. i usually wear a 6 in us sizing.,2
Beautiful well made top.it just runs small not for me,2
I got this dress to wear for christmas and it is perfect. looks great and is very comfy. low cut in front and back that is not too revealing and allows for perfect bra coverages. i got it in a small small.,2
"Couldn't make it work  even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan  like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all  just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust)  then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy  curvy waist  but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape. (5'3'' 127lb 34a  tried xs)",1
I bought this dress online to wear to work and i did not expect anything too impressive based on the picture of the model. i am really surprised at how beautiful  well-fitting  and soft this dress is. i am in love. it fits snugly  but the fabric is so thick that it is still very office appropriate (i work at a law firm). i ordered the small petite and it comes to the top of my knees.,2
I ordered this top in red based on one of the reviews. it is more like marroon. i am very disappointed. the top itself is plain cotton and not that great quality. it is long and has the belt at the back  but the fit and quality overall are very plain. it looks a tad dowdy. i am still keeping it because i got it on sale and i can wear it at home with lounge leggings. but it is definitely not dressy. perhaps white may not look as bad. the plain design and marroon dull color don't help.,0
"I decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet. i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured  only about 3 inches shorter. i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late  everything i seem to order is huge. this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured  a nice green. fabric was a gauzy cotton. the dress was just ""alright"". nothing special to warrant the price tag. it felt like a little girl's dress on me",1
My usual size was a bit large and baggy in most areas but the bust was sooo soo small. the button popped and i had barely moved. do not recommend this one for anyone with a bust. the detailing is very pretty though for someone that can make this work.,0
Absolutely stunning. the color  the pattern  the quality. i love everything about this top.,2
These look much cuter in the picture than in person. i found them to be very thin and cheap looking. i am pretty sure you could find a similar pair at a budget department store.,0
Love this top! it is a full/ swing top  but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly. i have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments. love both colors  and having fun wearing them. and after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic. runs true to size and in the arms slightly tight  so i went with my usual med and fits perfect. if you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size  otherwise very true to size,2
The fabric and design are gorgeous so i was hoping the top would work for me. sadly  it looked ridiculous on me. i wouldn't recommend the top for busty girls. it looked like a bell on me. fyi  it doesn't come with a camisole underneath.,0
I love so much about it... it really is a gorgeous piece!  i just cannot get over the shorter sleeve... there's something about it that makes me feel like it looks as though i bought it too small  or shrunk it in the dryer =0  i'm the only one commenting on that  so it must be me. lol. i think i'm going to begrudgingly return this one :(,2
This is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way. this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i can't wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots. it's not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well. love it.,2
I bought the calia tunic in blk/wht and in red motif. i love the black and white one. the cut is flattering and stylish. comfortable. you can dress it up or down. all good.   the red motif is cut differently. the neckline is very low. the shape is different from the black and white one. i am not sure why but i returned it.  neither shirt is as long as the one pictured on the model. i would recommend the black and white one though.,2
This one pulled across my shoulders and neck in a creepy way. did not like the way that it fit. returned,0
"This dress is extremely flattering on and looks a lot better when worn than on the hanger. the cut drapes very nicely and is true to size. i am 5 feet tall / 95lbs and the xxsp fit perfectly. it is a bit short however  so i would caution that it may not be work ""office"" appropriate if you are taller. like most hd in paris dresses  it is also quite thin although lined. this dress would look lovely with a either delicate jewelry or a bold statement piece and is casual enough for a lunch outing or",2
The moss color intrigued me so i ordered a medium instead of large because it looked oversized. i generally wear a large. medium is a good fit. probably could have ordered the small  but wanted to preserve the draping on the side. this top is very wide but it looks great on. so do size down. love the color variations. it's true to the pics and is a nice addition to my casual lifestyle.,2
These pants are comfortable and cozy. great for lounging around and cute enough to wear out of the house to coffee or running errands. i'll be wearing them a lot.,2
Really nice green blend of colors. fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum. i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket. is a bit itchy. need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath.,2
I love this top! the fit is perfect and i particularly like the longer back. there is a split between the shorter front and longer back which is brilliant so you can move and sit without it pulling around your bum. looks great with skinny jeans or with leggings. it is very light weight and is perfect for spring. the sleeves are slightly fitted and very comfortable. the quality and construction is great. i am 5 feet and got a petite xs which is perfect.,2
"Really pretty for summer  especially beach and pool wear. but i'm only 5'1 and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats (which is my preferred shoe for this dress). i'm also ""curvy and busty on top  so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows. but still it looks nice on  and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too. so i'm on the fence about keeping it  since it's really pretty for a summer party.",2
I got this for a special event and while i had to special order due to it not being in my local store yet  the minute i tried it on was very happy with the fit  feel and overall look. at the event i got so many compliments and love the way it fits - attractive  sturdy and very comfortable to wear  even with kicking up my heels on the dance floor. am so happy i got this and plan to wear it to other events coming up (weddings  parties  etc.),2
I have this top in orange and white. it is a great top to throw on with jeans. don't put it in the dryer  will shrink.,2
Perfect fit for my size. it elongate my petite frame.,2
These are really cute and done in a substantial knit type fabric that drapes well and doesn't cling. i ordered my normal size large. so i'd say they're true to size. the leg isn't too wide and bells out nicely toward the bottom. the color variations are striking but on me they made me look wider than i am. i'm short and the hem hit at the top of my ankle instead of the cropped look shown. think they'd look best with shorter tops. i decided to return but still highly recommend.,2
Cute tee. it's a casual tee with some nice detailing that gives it some style. the fabric is a good thickness. not see-through thin but light enough for warm weather. the color should match pretty much anything. nice neckline. i think it runs slightly large. i hover between a small  extra small with tops and the xs fit nicely. i do have narrow shoulders  32dd  so women with normal to wide shoulders might prefer their usual size. i don't expect people to gush over it with compliments but it it a,2
I was excited to see this top in person  but once i got a close up look at it (and also tried it on) i was disappointed. first  the color is much more persimmon orangey in person and that's a hard color to pull off for a lot of people. it just pulls any pink or red in your skin and highlights it.     second  the top was poorly finished. i had to pick up two to try on because the lace was wonky across the front of the first one i grabbed. so much so that the lace was puckered because it had been,1
"Love this top  but the xs is still way too big  swallows me. 5'1"" petite. wish it came in a petite offering. sadly  had to return this item.",2
I love this dress. i didn't think that i would feel at ease as it is very form-fitting. but it is so comfortable! and warm. it is dressy yet casual. i have received many compliments.,2
Love this blouse. it fits well with a slight flare at the bottom. doesn't wrinkle much and washes in cold water perfectly. have had compliments on the style and design. a definite buy!,2
I ordered the xxs  i think retailer has gone on the bigger size again and i went from small to xs to xxs... so true to size in that sense. i love the color (nude)  and it is pretty soft and comfortable. the cut is flattering  the cowl neck is pretty  the sleeves are shorter  and the hem is wider (aka swing). this would look totally adorable with my flare or wide leg jeans. i think ti would look nice too with skinnies  if you have leaner legs.    (for reference  30dd  26.5 in waist  115 lbs),2
I was so lucky to find these jeans in store yesterday and they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever had. the fit is amazing and wish they weren't sold out online or i would buy more!,2
Beautiful patterns and colors  but it sits very high and runs small. i'm normally a size 4 and got the small. zipped all the way  but on the snug side. the skirt sits so high that the fabric coming down was a bit awkward. such a shame because it really is beautiful and looks great on the model probably because she's wearing a belt to hide how high it rides and flares out.,1
I love this dress. it's beautiful and flattering. not to mention that it is also comfortable with a bit of stretch. i couldn't see it in the picture  but the black parts on the shoulders in front and on the back is sheer  so you have to be careful with underwear choice. i have an apple shape and yet this was flattering and the perfect length. i am short and apple-shaped and it was a great choice.,2
I bought this dress to wear to a funeral. i usually wear a medium but when i tried it on it was way too big so i exchanged it for a small which fit perfectly! the side slits make the dress a bit sexy and the styling is boxy but very comfortable especially with the pockets! the fabric lies beautifully on the body. i would recommend this dress.,2
This dress is adorable. dress it up or dress it down,2
This is a true retailer dress  cute and quirky. kudos for the built-in liner (with scalloped hem  very pretty) and pockets. i like the colorful yet subtle embroidered ice cream sticks on the dress  and the white background makes the colors and details really pop (pun intended!). i echo the previous reviewers that the bust is very small. i usually wear size 4 regular in this brand (i?m 34b  26 waist  36 hips. i?m 5?2?  and the bottom hem falls right at the upper knees). but when i tried on size 6 ,2
This top is really comfortable  and the details make it easy to add interest to an outfit. i was worried all the details together would be a bit overwhelming  but it works. i wish the design was on the back as well  but it's fine. the material is a nice light weight  but the pleats do fold up a little after washing  so ironing is required.,2
"I really wanted to like this dress. i am 5'3"" 125 lbs and this dress was about 4 inches too long. the hem created a puddle around my feet. i've bought other maxis from retailer without this problem. sadly it went back to the store.",0
This is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesn't look anything like that in reality. it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over. i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive.,0
Really great pair of pants/leggings. considering a second pair. great flattering fit. i ordered the petite as well because i was concerned about the length but the stride on the petite a was to short and the regular was not too long after all.,2
I ordered the mango and the navy in size 28. i am 5' and 130 lbs. both arrived with the size 28 label on them  the mango fit perfectly. perfect length on the legs and very flattering. the navy  on the other hand  was an inch shorter and an inch narrower! i kept double-checking the packing slip and the label inside the shorts to see if they accidentally sent a 27p. but no  it was clearly a 28. i brought that back to the store and ordered another navy 28  hoping that pair was just mislabeled 28 or,2
"I'm a 5'7""and curvy  these pants fit well and are so comfortable. i think everyone should own at least one pair!",2
I never would have thought that i could wear a jumpsuit and it actually look good on me  but this is it!!! the fabric is weighted some so it lays very flattering and is very comfortable. the sash can be tied several ways-front  back  or side. i will be traveling in this to the beach and pairing it with an retailer wrap  and then wearing it alone with sandals once we exit the freezing airplanes. a racer back bra works great with this piece and the pockets are an added bonus. it looks like a d,2
The fabric and its texture didn't meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric...   however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears.,1
Love love love this dress! i was worried the velvet would look cheap  but it absolutely does not! i bought an xxsmall and it is a little tight in the chest  but everything else fits perfectly ! i bought this in the slate color  but am seriously considering buying the lighter color as well!,2
This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage  so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer  i just couldn't make it work  .,1
I love this poncho/sweater. it feels cozy and looks really cool. can't wait til the weather cools down so i can wear it.,2
"Vibrant  lovely and quite long! this maxi works for leggy bettys - i stand 5'11"" in my stocking feet  and the dress hem grazed the floor. not quite as voluminous as the photo suggests  but stunning nonetheless. runs a bit small. i normally wear xs to s  and i tried a xs in-store  but it fit just ever-so-slightly too snug. i didn't try a size s  but i suspect it may have fit ever-so-slightly too large.",2
I love this blouse. i wasn't sure if i was going to like the high neck but it fits the style. the quality is excellent. i bought a size small and i wear a size 2-4 or xs-s in retailer most of the time. i could have worn the xs if i was a little smaller busted (34c). i'm 5'9 and i didn't like where the gathering hit with the xs. very flowy without looking like a maternity top. it's also lightly lined so i don't have to wear a cami. warning - this shirt is long. if you are on the short side you may,2
I was not going to purchase this jacket thinking it was too pricely but i am glad that i did. true to size and made with great craftsmanship. it looks very delicate but made strong. very pretty .... true too picture. it works out perfect for after yoga!,2
"I absolutely loved the look of this top and had to try it on  so i ordered it in xs and s because i own a few other tylho shirts and know they can run large. when they arrived  i could tell with just one look how huge this top runs. i didn't even bother opening the s. for reference  i'm 5'4"" and 135lb  32c  and the xs is slightly too big through my bust. it's barely snug underneath my arms and not at all fitted down the sides of my ribcage  but i'm okay with that since it allows more room to wea",2
I'm 5'8  130 and a small fits nice. these are different with the silky fabric  pattern and piping - busy but still classy. it is hard to match with a shirt as you need a shorter top so you don't lose too much of the pant's unique design.,2
"Love this dress! i'm 5'4""  110 lbs. i ordered 2p. the dress is stretchy at all the right places and accentuates your curves. it's very well-made. i usually like loose fitting clothes  but i feel this dress needs to be snug but not tight. i tried 4p and it was just a bit loose. this dress is well-worth the price.",2
I got this in the dark coral color. it is lovely. i'm taking it to hawaii!,2
This color is perfect: deep and rich. it is exactly as it looks on-line. the velvet is super-soft on the outside  while the inside is more of a woven finish. it makes it a little less cozy  but the drape is great. the fit is slim across the shoulders and chest  and full everywhere else. the waist is lower in the back than the front  so it sits lower on the hip. i'm 5'4  140  34b  and i got a small petite  because i liked where it hit my waist better. this means i won't be wearing it without tigh,2
This is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors. it is form-fitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions - i plan to wear it for my son's graduation  but i think there are many potential uses for this dress. be aware that  like many byron lars sheath dresses  the bottom part is very tight- makes it hard to fit for more pear-shaped people. the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug. however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t,2
This jacket is absolutely beautiful. the color is a much deeper navy than it appears in the pictures  and the brocade with the contrasting lining is lovely. however  as another reviewer commented  the back across the shoulders is incredibly small. i ordered up from my normal 2 to a 4  and it was still too tight. there is no way i could even lift my arms over my head without ripping out the back of the jacket. i fear a 6 will be too big. this one is going back  sadly.,2
It is a pretty tank  the fabric feels nice and substantial.,2
Just buy this dress! the slip  the hem  the print. everything about it!!,2
Got this shirt in black so i can wear it to work.  more personality than a plain t-shirt but still comfortable.  got lots of compliments.,2
I was able to grab two of these in grey and navy during one of their awesome sales. it doesn't look like much on the hanger  but it's lovely on the body. ____________ pros: - lots of stretch. - comfortable and roomy without looking frumpy. - lovely color and texture. - can size up or down depending on how you want it to look. - minimizes bust size nicely. ____________ cons: - if you have curves like me  it won't be as roomy as the model  unless you size up. i actually bought a size down and it b,1
"This blouse is gorgeous. first of all  it's cotton! so  it is extremely comfortable. it isn't tighter in some areas more than others  but fits evenly throughout  which although a rarity  is wonderful. finally  a blouse that fits perfectly! i am 5'3"" and 108 pounds. i ordered the regular xs and it hits right at my hips. i have a longer torso  however  so although i am not tall  the petite would have been too short for me. it is beautifully made and the red is a beautiful crimson on white. grab th",2
The fit on these is amazing and the color is great too! sometimes the fading is too much on jeans but this is just right. the rise fits really well and the length is great! love pilcro!,2
Wasn't sure whether i would like the top from the online picture  but it is so much more flattering in person. can be worn as a casual piece with denim skinnys or dressed up with a pencil skirt.,2
"I love this jumpsuit! i'm usually a size small  however i was a lot more comfortable in an xs. the fit was comfortable and sexy! i received a lot of compliments and a couple of ""i need to borrow that from you""! i'm only 5' tall so it went down all the way to my ankles but i paired it with 4"" open toed heels and it worked! the neck line is pretty high but you can adjust it to your comfort. i highly recommend this jumpsuit ...even to the petite ladies!",2
This is not your basic white tee. the ruffle and seam down the front add visual interest. cute alone or paired with a sweater and statement necklace.,2
This romper is absolutely gorgeous. the embroidery is detailed and lovely and the fit is feminine and flattering. it's super versatile and easy to dress up or dress down depending where you want to wear it. i'm in love!   it is a little on the sheer side  though  and i chose to wear a tank top underneath for more coverage  but this was an easy fix. it was a reasonable trade off to wear a camisole under in exchange for the lightweight and flowy material. totally obsessed.,2
I love love love this dress for everyday running around or you can dress it up with jewelry or a scarf. so boho and so comfortable. buying the other color now.,2
"I'm so glad i found this gem in the store  as the online pic does this shirt no justice!  the green version is vibrant and adorable  and this shirt is lightweight  without being see-through.  for sizing reference: i'm 5'4""  135 lbs  34c and a size 6 petite.  i tried this in the store in a size 4 and an 8 (only sizes they had) and rushed home to order it online in a 6.  perfect fit  so i believe its true to size.  the little details...the buttons and stitching make this shirt such a winner!",2
This is my first time purchasing a bra from this brand and i am in love. the style and quality are amazing. it is the most comfortable bra i owned to date and i will be buying more from this line. it provides a lift without all of the uncomfortable padding which requires continuous adjusting. i am saying goodbye to vs forever. i got this in red and the bra looks more expensive than it actually is and the fit is simply amazing.it is sexy and classic at the same time.,2
The petite was a little bit long on me (i'm 5'2)  but it otherwise fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable  breezy. covers enough that it is work appropriate or for something outside. a keeper!,2
I ordered my usual medium. the tops length came only to my waist  and was wide and unflatering.   the armholes were right under my arms. too bad as this looked so cute in the picture. i returned.,1
I bought this during the 20% off and i'm glad i did. the sweater does run large  so i would recommend sizing down. i'm 5'4  135 lbs  with a larger bust (34d) and even the size small is large on me (not large enough to exchange  but i would probably do better with an xs; even with an xs i would still get that oversized look). the color is not exactly as pictured  it is a brighter yellow in person. i was expecting more of a muted  soft  baby yellow  and that's not exactly what this is. some pros a,2
Dress is silk? it's soft and pretty. it's blue so you can wear brown or blue suede boots! i caught my reflection a few times and thought i looked really bottom heavy. dress is awesome. worth it.,2
In the fall  i purchased every single color of the left of center swing top. long sleeve  great colors and very easy to wear. when i saw these  i swooned. these are very similar knit to the left of center  but the swing is bigger and the linen insets on the side make this easy top even more beautiful! these run true to size...basically you are only fitting your arms and chest. this top will definitely has a little give with wear  which will just add to the shape and effortlessness. the linen ins,2
I agree with almost everything the previous reviewer said with one notable exception: probably because she and i have very different figures  i am able to wear the sweater fully snapped with the belt cinching my waist creating a peplum effect. i wore this jacket to a party as a top over a black band aid skirt (code for tight-fitting and tastefully short) with black semi-opaque tights and black booties. the look was classy  but edgy having paired a delicate floral pattern and unusually feminine n,2

I bought this top in all colors as i love it so much! it is lightweight and perfect for our hot/humid summers. i actually wear the top backwards because the front of the top is longer that the back. to me it looked stranger to have it longer in the front! size wise  i think this top runs pretty large. i am usually a medium in most tops  sometimes a small  and i purchased this in a small petite. it fits great. i even tried on the xs petite and while it still fit in armpits and chest  it was just,2
"Effortless and super cute! i'm currently wearing my blue tunic for the first time with black leggings and booties - i absolutely love the everyday comfort of this piece! a few have mentioned length as being an issue - i'm wearing a regular s (my normal size) at 5'7"" and find the length similar to the model's. the cut on this is perfect - i was worried that it would look like a plaid sack on  but it's a slim cut that looks polished without needing to be belted. this will surely be a go-to for me",2
Order at least one size down or the double v neckline will insist on slipping off your shoulders. everything else about this top is great.,2
I was hesitant to buy these jeans online because citizens are generally not very forgiving  being that they don't have much stretch.  they are always in the stack that i try on but haven't bought a pair of citizens in several years. these are totally different!  the have enough stretch to be sculpting without being uncomfortable while keeping the substantial feeling that comes with denim versus leggings.  i looooooove these jeans!!!,2
I just got this dress in the beige color and i absolutely love it. the fit is perfect and i feel that it is just the right length. i got a small and i am 5'9''. the pockets are a great touch and really are the key for tunic style dresses for me. i love the soft material and could live in this dress. such a great staple for my closet!,2
I bought this top on a whim - it's not 100% my style  but wanted to try something different. the fabric and print are amazing! so unique  soft  subtle  and delicate. great fit as well. my only complaint is not the fault of the top  but if you have a bit of tummy  the fold at the peplum really brings it out so you'd have to wear high-waisted bottoms or suck it in. the hem is also really flowy  more so than shown in the pictures. theres a lot of fabric so it kind of ruffles more at the bottom rath,2
"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and got it as soon as it went on sale 25% off. the colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect whether you have areas that you want to hide or not. it is true to size and i can see how you would want to size it down since it's baby doll shape  but it didn't work for me around the arm holes (and mine are not that big). i am 5'3"" and 120 lb and size 2 worked perfect.",2
I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top  which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well  made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress  flowing and cool.,0
This dress is wonderful. fits perfect. very comfortable. wonderful colors.,2
"I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews  but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants  but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these.",1
I bought this top in my usual size large based on other reviews and it fit perfectly.   i have long arms and the sleeves are the perfect length.  the fabric is a slightly stretchy jacquard and very nice quality.   the top is definitely more fitted with a significant amount of fabric at the peplum portion.   i wish that this was a bit less  which is why i only gave it 4 stars.  otherwise  it's a great top for fall that can be dressed up with a pencil skit or more casually with jeans.  definitely,2
To my surprise this sweater is heavy  chic and stylish. its well made and fits tts. i'm looking forward to wearing it. i would recommend this tunic to everyone. it looks better on me than the model.....event though it doesn't look bad. you need curves to enhance the look of this tunic sweater. i really like all the different textures in this sweater.,2
I was tempted to get this online but just wasn't sure i wanted to buy even with the sale because i only wear dresses to the knee and didn't know how this would look with leggings or jeans. i tried it on in the store the next day and it was so cute! there are long skinny black tassels in the front that you can't really see in the online pics that i love. it looks great with my skinny jeans with tears or black leggings and boots. i even have some cute leggings just past the knee that this looks aw,2
I am in love with this piece! i am long waisted and large busted so finding a jumpsuit to fit me can be challenging  having said that i sized up when ordering this  wrong ladies....no need....i had to reorder my normal size and even that was roomy  but in a good way as i prefer belting it with my huge concho belts. i purchased it in the rasberry and i am still scratching my head as to why the black sold first  the red is stunning and i find it more versatile going from casual to dressy. and this,2
Well-made  gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person  which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great! (i'm a 34b across brands like vs  etc.)   you'll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing you're wearing something this sexy.,2
I had been looking for something like this to add to my summer wardrobe. fortunately for me i saw these in the retailer catalog and thought  how perfect  exactly what i've been searching for. they are a bit pricey  and crotch hangs a bit lower on me because i'm only 5'3  but it's not enough to make me send them back  i will have them altered if need be  they are to cute.     i'm a size 4 in pants and ordered the 29  i wanted some wiggle room  i didn't realize the denim has stretch  i will keep the,2
Nice basic top...i will get plenty of use out of this! love the neckline.,2
This is a great pullover. very cute for lounging at home or running errands. it does run large  i ordered an xs & it's pretty big. for reference  i'm 5'7''  125 lbs & 34 b. it is also a little pricey for lounge wear but i am keeping it because it is so cute.,2
Beautiful material and taupe color. the slits are pretty high on both sides  so just be aware of that.,2
I got this in peach  and am not ashamed to say that i wore it almost every day in the past week - over a tee  over a dress  over a tunic...it looks good with everything! my normal size s is on the looser side compared to my other retailer bombers  but i like it for layering purposes. so soft and comfy...i have a feeling i'm going to need a backup of this one!,2
3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,0
"I ordered my usual size small and it was very large on my 5'5""  112# frame.  my daughter loved it so she scored.  i ordered another one in xs  perfect though the sleeves run long! i have long arms.  can be dressy or casual.",2
Really comfortable  great for casual event or everyday wearing. best style with jeans.,2
"I thought  this is nice  when it was a new arrival i put it in my wish lsit as i liked how the cut looked on the modl. but i dind't think i would love it as much on me (i ordered it when it hit sale#. the material is ""fluffy""  and has a shimmer you can't see on the online picture. one of hte thread will need to be cut  but no biggie  it is so ute. the beading is also very subtle  but pretty. my stylist #brught it in t try onin the store# loved it somuch she is ordering one for herself. the cut i",2
Love this dress! it is so comfortable and can be worn as casual or dress up.,2
I love the idea of this shirt  but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off  but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br,0
My expectations were blown away in the best way when i tried on this top.  i typically have issues with button-downs in the chest area (buttons never lay flat) and this top lays perfectly.  the material is super soft.  looks great buttoned all the way up or with a few buttons left open.  i can't wait to wear with a pair of black high-waisted jeans this fall!,2
Love this tunic...and so do others! so many compliments already!! i've worn it with skinny jeans as well as flowy black pants. it needs a cami underneath since it's sheer. i also like to wear it with my long retailer necklaces!,2
This top is gorgeous! it's a nice weight and the cami that comes with it makes it drapes nicely. i'll have to send it back though because it's too big. i'm always a medium but in this i'll be a small. :(,2
The dress runs big you should size down. i find the weight to be great for mild winter weather. the length was longer than i expected based on previous reviews.,2
"Bring back the old retailer timeless pieces! this cardigan is very flattering  the flutter sleeves add a romantic touch to the cardigan. the colors are neutral  and the vine part (black) is like velvety. the fit is super flattering  i originally bought hte xs in the store  but decided to also order the xs petite to compare ( i am 4115 lbs  5'1.5"" and 30 dd  with 26-27 waist). both fit  but the petite was better fitted on my waist. also  the length would work better on top of dresses. i also tried",2
To be honest  i bought this sweater as an add-on so i could get free shipping; however  it's the only piece i actually kept from the order! this sweatshirt is warm (fleece-lined) and just the right amount of billow. but the best part is the subtle lavender color; when i ordered it  i didn't even realize i ordered lavender (again  i wasn't paying much attention to this piece!)  but the color and texture are so soft...definitely a must buy! for reference  i am 5'3  110 pounds and the xs (my usual,2
"Beautiful pink top.  comfortable  love the color and print   style and sleeves.  good quality.  didn't have the issues with the placement of the bees over my breasts that other reviewers did. the bees were at the sides of my breasts. covered my butt for the most part in jeans. flattering cut.  i got an xs (5'2""  34b  115#).",2
This is every bit as lovely as shown! the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks  lace embellishment's and covered buttons. for me  tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) my normal size. i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area. going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts. i think it's a wonderful rendition of a denim top. this would work in any season of the year.,2
This feels and looks like a ballet skirt on  so light and flowy  super comfortable  just love it! extremely flattering cut  tiny gathered folds at waistband add pretty detail and create a slimming effect on my tummy  what's not to love?! great pockets too! i have a 34 inseam and the length is perfect. ordering in both colors now as i can see these becoming my go to bottoms all summer long....,2
Normally i would not have bought this color and print  it is just not a color that i usually wear. but after reading reviews i ordered it online. i love love this top. it looks good  is flattering  and is a very nice and different color. i wore it with berry leggings and love it. the top is very comfortable  can be worn with pants and leggings. the only issue i have is that since the jersey fabric is only at the back and not in the front  it pulls at the tummy section in the front and shows an o,2
Pretty blush color that is still neutral enough to wear with just about any outfit. runs true to size imo. can't wait to wear it this fall/winter.,2
Top is very wide and flowy. i am petite with large chest so it hung from widest point and was not flattering. would be very cute with the right body shape.,1
I've tried or bought nearly every retailer cashmere sweater this season. this one fits the best and the yellow is a bit darker in person  not quite mustard but a deep rich yellow. i wish they would offer more colors.,2
The fabric is quality  nice thicker fabric. the fit was strange  the top part fit great through the arms and shoulders  except my bust makes the front stick out and results in a maternity look. it was also slightly wide  i considered taking it in on the sides. ultimately it wouldn't be worth the money. it would be a great top for someone with a smaller chest.,0
I really wanted to like this dress on me  but it was not to be. the color is one of my favorites  but the dress accented all my problem areas. sadly  i returned it. i'm sure that someone with less substantial hips will look great in it.,1
This top is very nice. i ordered it in black  it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric  however  feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable  it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton  i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.,1
"I loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets. the fabric was a nice weight  not too thin like lots of retailer tops. i liked the top from the front  however the back was way too long  especially with the looseness of the style. it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted. it might work on someone taller. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. and i tried xs.",1
I liked the product shots of this cardigan  but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of ...unimpressed... the green wasn't quite the color i was expecting  the fabric was rougher  the lace was scratchy  the fit was boxy  and the sleeves are very dolman... none of which translated through the pictures online... i still think it's cute  but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting. i might reconsider if it hits sale  but for now it goes back...,1
This tunic looks great in person whether you get the red  green  or navy. runs true and hangs well--the ruffle at the bottom is super flattering and the construction of this tunic is impressive! so good i had to get both the red and navy!,2
The color is perfect for fall.  dressy enough for work  and looks great with a pair of jeans.,2
This dress' style and color is very flattering. i think i will wear it in the spring and fall as well as the winter.the m fits me and i'm 5'8' and 140 pounds.,2
Beautiful dress! wanted something different. even bought the hat ! very flattering.,2
Love this sweater! it is easy to wear and goes well with multiple outfits. it is a great  flexible add to my wardrobe. it fits well  even in the sleeves!,2
I love this top. the design is very good  i love the pleats at the back  and i tried both colors. i prefer blue even though both look good. the fit is very loose mainly due to the pleats at the back. i usually wear xl but bought this in an l  which was also very loose. i think an m would be too tight across the shoulders but loose lower because of the pleats. i am keeping the blue because i like this style  with fitted pants it would work well.,2
I ordered this in size xl and it is a perfect top. the draping is very flattering to my shape. the material is soft and the flowers/colors are appropriate for work. it's the perfect length too. i love everything about the cut of this top. the pattern will vary on each since the flowers are staggered. i love the knot effect along the waist. great purchase. hope this style will continue to be used for other tops in other patterns/colors for spring/summer timeframe. these are a little too dark/heav,2
"I ordered this in xs and it fits loosely (i am 5'3"" and about 120 lbs). this looks great with skinny jeans or leggings and shows off the long necklaces that are in style right now. the chiffon doesn't lie perfectly along the side seam  but i'm sure only i notice.",2
"Surprisingly versatile and figure flattering without being too clingy and revealing like so many ""bandage"" dresses. the navy color softens the stripes. great piece for travel as it is light and does not wrinkle. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. with a smaller chest and curvy hips. the small fits perfectly.",2
Love this top! not too low cut  drapes nicely and the material is thin enough but not so thin you have to wear a tank top. it does seem to run on the larger side.,2
Just purchased this sweater in store as a christmas present for my self and i'm in love! i feel the fit besides the shoulders which are somewhat narrow  is perfect. i usually wear a petite medium in everything but had to go with the regular small because they didn't have petites in the store. i tried on the regular medium and it was just slightly too big everywhere. overall i am so pleased with this purchase. so happy i popped into retailer today and saw it!,2
These are super comfy and a great fitting everyday short. the embroidery gives them a nice touch. i am ordering another pair!,2
I actually ended up buying two of these dresses. i took the first one to the dry cleaner and they chewed up the slip and put a hole in the dress. i was so sad that i went and bought a second one before they could sell out. the good news is that it was on sale! this is an awesome light and airy dress that is great for those hot summer days. i pretty much wear it every opportunity i get. for reference i purchased the small. it's loose but the shoulders  armholes and slip all fit perfectly. i weigh,2
Sadly  i returned this one. i'm a 36d bra size and this shirt could not handle that. it fit around my chest  so sizing up was not necessary  but my chest caused the straps to shift and sit funny on my shoulders. cute top and well made for those who can fit into it better!,1
Beautiful lace shell! great with jeans for a night out  or with a skirt for a more formal affair. good quality  not itchy.,2
These pants feel great. fit is true to size. the blue color is very unique. definitely recommend!,2
I have vowed to only purchase high-waisted bottoms from here on out because they are just more in line with my style! these shorts did not disappoint. i love that they're versatile enough to wear with a cute top + wedges or with a t-shirt and flats. great find! (i got my normal sz. 25 which is usually a tight fit  these zipped up perfectly though!),2
This is a simple design  but feminine and dressy enough for a summer wedding.  this dress is great for hourglass shapes  but it does not hide your features.,2
I tried this in the store a few weeks ago when it just came out because i loved the neutral design and look of it and came back the following week to purchase it with my discount code because it really is worth it...  _______  pros:  - true a-line silhouette. if you have curves and hips like i do (5'9  36c  hourglass  165 lbs)  then this skirt will flatter you completely. there's a lovely swing to the dress and it drapes wonderfully because it's a thicker fabric.  - runs tts. i can normally wear,2
Love the material and how the back is longer than the front! adds style!,2
This dress is very comfortable  lovely  and versatile. i know i will wear this often throughout the spring and summer months because of it's elegant ease. i purchased a small and am a 34c and 28 waist; fits perfectly.,2
"I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2""  115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a ""petite"" style dress. however  i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress  i was first shocked that for the price  the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on  it was clear that th",1
"I am 5'7"" and 36a cup. i tried on the small and it fits perfectly. i can see how if i was bustier it could be a problem. it looks better in person  dressy enough for the office but comfortable fabric and nicely shaped. i love this with jeans and can't wait to wear it to work!",2
"I absolutely love these shorts. i do  however feel they run on the large side. i am 5'1"" and normally wear a 24  25  0 or 00 and bought these in an xs. i would have gotten an xxs if they were available  but that was not an option. they are a little baggy  but they are so great i could not pass them up. these are too good to pass on.",2
I absolutely love ag stevie ankle jeans and own them in three different colors. i'm on the shorter side  so in terms of length i'm able to wear them as regular jeans. the fabric is comfy and stretchy and the range of colors is great for wardrobe diversity and mixing and matching! this particular style is my absolute favorite. although ag jeans are on the pricier side  after i bought my first pair i was a convert. as opposed to other brands  i find that they are a worthwhile investment. as other,2
It lays very nicely on your body. very flattering!!!!,2
These pants are a great fit. perfect for the in-between seasons. casual comfortable but look very nice and polished when worn. a practical steal at retailer's sale prices.,2
Wonderful colors and fit tts. love the style. can were on or off the shoulders . love it!!!,2
This dress is amazing! i bought this dress for my daughter for her college graduation. it fits like a dream. she normally wears a size 2 but i got the 4 which was perfect. with the slightly longer length  it is very professional but with the lace cut outs is great for a party  as well. it is very flattering and well made.,2
I was excited to see these on sale in the honey color i wanted. unfortunately  they were really more of a yellow than the golden color in the photo. also  they were so baggy in the rear that i looked silly  which was surprising since i don't have a small behind. unfortunately all the smaller sizes were sold out. had to send them back.,1
I specifically bought this dress for my bridal shower and loved it! i'm small on top and have hips that don't lie. i purchased the size 2 petite. the waist portion of the dress came up a little higher which was ok since it fell at a small part of my waist. the length was just above my knee  which i prefer. the dress has a nude lining which compliments my tan skin tone. i wore a regular nude bra that didn't show beneath the liner. i received many compliments and would highly recommend it.     the,2
This top looks beautiful online. when i got it  it looks nothing like the pic. it's wide  too much fabric  no shape and so unflattering. it's definitely going back,0
The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy  but they just looked sloppy. also  the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft  but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.,0
"Fits true to size! looks great just wish it was a tad longer but i am 5'10"" so...",2
I love most pure and good clothing pieces  mostly because the fit and fabric are comfy and made of good quality materials. this tunic does deliver on both counts  but i is very  very long and straight up and down. fyi: i have a boyish figure  having no waist/hips. i have a broad shoulder/back  so the cowl neckline coupled with the very long and straight tunic doesn't really flatter my body. it would be okay for just haging around the house  but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this tunic out,1
I like the tunic but there are no care instructions in the garment. if i wash it once and it shrinks or the dye runs it will be going back. please send care instructions.,1
I love this dress! it's super comfortable--soft fabric and doesn't bind anywhere--yet somehow it's still feminine and sexy. i get compliments on it wherever i go! also  it works all year-round (in winter it can be easily paired with boots  tights  a long-sleeved black t-shirt  etc.).,2
This dress is amazing. nice material  comfortable and really flattering. slightly tight in the arms but otherwise perfect. highly recommended!!!,2
As other reviewers have said  this is the perfect summer maxi dress! i'm tall  just under 6 feet  and while the dress could be just a bit longer it still works for my height. i do wish the skirt was lined  but other than that the dress is excellent. worth buying at full price if you're worried about it selling out!,2
I love this dress! there are so many different looks you can get just by adjusting the straps or shoulders. the material is lightweight and flows with every turn. i ordered my usual size 10 and it fits perfectly. i did need a little assistance in getting the side zip to go up  but once it was on i didn't want to take it off.,2
Love this sweater for so many reasons; fits true to size  unique in design  versatile  soft and so easy to wear. i've worn it tied in the back and front. it goes great with a skirt or dress pants for work  date night and elevates the look with any of my jeans. i love haying clothes i can get the most out of. highly recommend this sweater!,2
Received this dress  the sleeves are very pretty  the drape was just what i was looking for  but the overall dress was not very flattering on me. i am a little busty on top so it pulled in a unflattering way. i would say that if you are tall and not on the busty side this could be an amazing dress on. this one had to go back,1
"This beauty caught my eye online and i was excited to see it in store. the coloring is lovely  but it was too short for me (5'7"") and just meh...and it was only on for a second before it started itching. sadly  too  the sleeves were all stretched out from the way my local store merchandised it  which looks cute on the hanger but kind of ruins the clothes (i wish they'd stop doing this). if it works for you  great because it's a decent price for a timeless sweater with an interesting color patter",1
I ordered this blouse after it went on sale - i'm not typically the blouse-y type  but i thought i'd try it. for me  and i'm a pretty consistent small across brands  it was quite flowing and a little long  but that may be what someone wants. it was a little light in color to look good on me  but i think this would be really cute with dark skinny jeans - easy to dress up or down :),2
I purchased the purple motif in petite size small. it hits just the right length for me  but i can see that if i were any larger chested  it might be an issue. (for reference  i'm a 32d  5'4  112lb.) it's very forgiving on the tummy area  without looking bulky (other moms know what i'm talking about and understand my appreciation for this). the shirt is also a nice quality  really comfortable  and it's easy to wear with jeans  shorts  skirts  etc.  making it a welcome versatile piece.,2
I love this top. it's very comfortable looks great and the quality is very good. i've had many compliments on it.,2
This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which  for me  defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd)  so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.,2
I loved this purchase. the dress is beautiful. it?s classy  very feminine and rich-looking. the colors and fabric are exactly as shown on a picture. it is tailored and non-stretch  so size has to be right. i am between 6 and 8 and my size m dress fits well. had to spend time shopping for a belt as the dress definitely needs one. gorgeous dress!,2
I saw this duster and immediately ordered it in cream. i have worn it every chance i get. it goes well with dresses as well as shorts or jeans. the length is perfect  the design is flattering  and the material is soft and comfortable. the sleeves are snug- but i like this feature  especially for light weight summer use over a tank top or sleeveless blouse. this will be a go to item. thanks retailer- another gem!,2
"This is a bit pricey  but it's the most beautiful sweater that i own. it fits beautifully  and the material is soft  not itchy  which is important for a sweater with a cowl neck. the cowl sits beautifully  no matter how you ""fold"" it. and  the pattern both at the neck and the bottom is vibrant and bright  and is just lovely. i ordered a small and it covers my butt  which is perfect for leggings  or even with tights and boots. it's not shapeless  but seems to graze your thighs  and has a mild tur",2
"I love the idea of this coat and foolishly purchased other items in happy anticipation of its arrival.    the description does not say ""lined "" and i hoped for soft wool that i recently got on the ""yellow with white piping"" sweater coat. this is hard  coarse  itchy wool - impossible for me to wear an unlined garment. i am consistently puzzled by the high prices for garments that are unlined when they really need to be. it went back  and i cannot really recommend this as i know i am not the only",0
The lace detail is very classy. a great go to white dress.,2
I bought this dress for spring/early summer thinking it was light and airy but the fabric is too heavy. because the color is dark (even with the flecks of peach)  combined with the heavy fabric  it's too much for spring. this dress is perfect for early fall weather. the dress fits fabulous and very flattering. i love the side pockets. it hits all the right places. i'm hourglass shaped  full figured. i normally wear size 14/16 and i bought this dress in lg. again  it fits great  but too heavy for,2
I'm about 10-15 lbs overweight and the material clings a bit. this would be a wonderful top for someone who has a nice shape.,1
It was lighter weight than i expected but that's perfect for me considering florida winters are mild. it's more like a wool sweater than coat. the design is gorgeous  however  ran bigger than anticipated. i'm hoping an exchange to the xs will work otherwise i'm not sure i can get the fit i expect from this sweater coat. the buttons are plastic and would have made a much bigger impact if they were wooden but they're still nice. overall i love it and am hoping for the right fit so i can flaunt thi,2
"This is a really cute style of t-sihrt. i totally disagree with the reviewers who thought this was too short in the torso and/or overwhelming. i'm 5'8"" and about 145 pounds and this fits just fine. (i ordered a size small.) beautiful drape and (i thought) relatively slim cut. the only reason i'm not giving this 5 stars across the board is that the fabric is a little too thin (not sheer or see-through  but not as substantial as i would expect for the price.",2
I have mixed feelings about this dress. the color is fantastic. not too bright  not too dark. the material is super soft and comfortable and the length was perfect. i did end up returning this item though as no matter which bra i chose  the straps showed. it just was not hitting my right on the shoulders. i do not like having my bra straps show or constantly be trying to tuck them away (especially at a wedding or work?). this is what ultimately led me to return the dress ? even though it is beau,1
"Just bought this dress in a 6. i'm 5'7"" 138 lbs (32b  29 in jeans). this is *so* much better than pictured. it's an empire waist that really flatters my small bust and accentuates the thin part of the waist. i have an hourglass figure  but can see this working great for pear shapes. i wish the material felt softer  but the fit was so perfect  even for my broad shoulders. will transition nicely to warmer weather  but for now  i plan to wear it with leggings and a cardigan.",2
This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it's not going to work. too boxy. too short. and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine.,0
I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak,0
Love this soft sweatshirt. the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great. go to piece for spring. loose fitting but true to size in shoulders.,2
I was so excited about this top  super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold  hand wash  air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed.,0
This is a cute stylish sweater different from the typical. it doesn't itch which is key at least for me. i ordered an extra small but i am normally a small since it seems to run long. i think the neckline is unique :),2
Agreed with the previous reviewer  this is the same dress as the evanthe dress that came out this summer  but in a rich beautiful red/wine color. the color differences in the pattern are   however  more subtle than the summer version  remaining in one palette. yo u can't tell from the picture  but the back is longer than the front. the neckline is very flattering  i found this one a little more snug than the evanthe (around the rib cage)  tried on 00p (size for evanthe) might be better as 0p in,2
It's beautiful  lovely quality  gorgeous bird. but the fit just doesn't work for me. i'm usually a medium  which is what i got  it's just too tight in the chest. for ref 36d. as is it already flares out some in the bottom so i'm not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately,2
I love this jumper!  it is absolutely gorgeous and also quite possibly the most comfortable piece of clothing i've ever owned.,2
I was looking for a new pair of pajama pants/around-the-house pants/occasional-quick-errand pants to replace a pair that i bought from retailer six years ago and i fell in love with the look of these.they are truly comfy and are flattering on. the lace adds a nice feminine touch that makes me feel pretty even on my laziest days. i'm hoping these will last me another six years.,2
"I am going to review this pretty much the way the person ahead of me reviewed it. first  the colors are way more vibrant in person than in the photo. there is even a lavender (which you can sort of see under the yellow stripe). it really makes it look different. second  it is monstrously huge. i am 5'3""  110 pounds and i ordered the xs and it completely swallowed me up. because of the vibrancy of the colors  it didn't blend well with my fair complexion and also  it is like a heavy sweater  not a",0
"I saw this in the store and grabbed it to try on due to the material and the back. i was surprised how nice it felt on and how the back looked. i had a blue bra on and it really could not be seen which was a worry. i loved how the back lay and that it was shorter in the front. even for the sale price it was expensive  but i went home with it!! it will go great with long skirts  jeans  and any color pants. i was very happy to walk out of the store with it. i am 5'4"" and about 120. i have a slende",2
Finally decided to join the yoga-wear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style. my size l tights were just that -- tight! so tight  i really didn't want to pull them up past the knee!! i am not kidding. i wear size 14 pants and my legs are toned and shapely  so there was no reason to expect a l wouldn't fit. so sad.,2
They are as comfortable as sweat pants. i can wear these all day and then some and be comfy. i love the fit (skinny's can be hard for me - i have athletic thighs) and the length is fantastic. i want more pairs in different washes!!,2
"I purchased the blue s (140lbs  5'8""  34b) and this was very large and boxy on me. not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price. the blue color is very pretty in person--darker and slightly marled. however  although this sweater is certainly cashmere (and very soft because of it)  it is very thin--to the point that i consider this a ""top"" rather than a ""sweater."" the silk panel in back is pretty but  again  thin and unlined. i think that  even on sale  this is ov",1
I absolutely love these capris. after reading the reviews  i thought that they may fit a bit snug through the thigh  but they fit perfectly. i am roughly a size six (depending on the design  i can sometimes squeeze into a 4). i bought the size 27 in these and its perfect. also  i thought that the green would be more of a mint  but its definitely a more of a mossy color. i love that they are so versatile and literally go with everything! will be getting more colors in the future! great buy!,2
I received this top in white  last fri.  and have already worn it twice. it is the perfect top for hot weather because it doesn't cling to the body. the top layer is flowy and breathable. i plan on buying the blue one next to get me through the warm weather months.,2
I like this top and agree that it does run large. i find the fabric to be somewhat heavy which i consider a good thing as it will hang nicely and do a good job of hiding *imperfections*. it does have a pleat in the back which is not so apparent in the photo here. i love the neckline... a slight bit of a *v* neck.,2
"I usually wear a size small in deletta. i am 5'5"" and 140 pounds. the small ran true to size for me. saying that i am a size 8 so usually everywhere else i can take small or medium  so i can see how reviewers say it runs big. love the ruffles on this tank. makes it a little more special. super comfy and easy to wear. will be great for hot summer days in florida!",2
I am 5'9  very long waisted  generally a size 10-12 or med  but ordered the large to ensure it would not ride up. (and this brand has run small in the past) i am keeping the large but also ordering a med to compare as i have room to spare - length and width either way  this is a keeper!! it is adorable on  comfortable  my t-back bra works perfectly  very flattering  and way better than expected the shorts length is a little longer than pictured  but there is an elastic waist with a cami under an,2
As other reviewers have said ~ the colors are more muted but good fall colors! quality top with lining and bead detail on hem and sleeves. flowy  loose fit ~ very cute with skinny jeans and booties. i would size down if you are small chested. great boho top.,2
I purchased this dress in the blue version. its a lovely dress that would be perfect for summer. the dress fit tts on me .. it is a little low in the neck area and it is a little uncomfortable in the torso area. i am on the fence about keeping it. the skirt is flouncy  cute and fun. i hope i can get it to work,2
"These jeans are worth every penny! they fit me perfectly as soon as i put them on  and i wore them the rest of the day! they are true to size with very generous stretch...if anything  i would size down. they feel durable  but not like typical denim. very soft. i am 5'3"" and about 117 or so  and my normal 25 fit like a dream. i did end up exchanging these because there was a small nick on the inside of the left thigh  and i was afraid they might tear right open. if the new pair comes without defe",2
I was debating getting the petite vs. regular sizing. i ended up going with the regular sizing for the addition couple of inches in length. it is very comfortable and not at all a sweatshirt but more of a heavyweight  wider long sleeve.,2
This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of  it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it's shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.,1
This dress in the blue motif has a really flattering fit and look. the dress especially in this color  hides the belly area well and does not make you look wide if you are heavier in the bottom half. it is not too short and goes past my knee. i am 5'3'.'' the material is also really soft and the dress is easy to pull on.,2
I guess i am in a comfort clothing mood these days since i have been looking at a lot of them lately! this one is a nice thicker material and i like that the sleeves go all the way down  but i am not a fan of the design. i felt the color scheme was very plain. the neckline comes up higher on me than i would have expected and makes me feel like i am choking. it is not a flattering cut on me and does not accentuate anything i would want it to  nor does it hide imperfections. it truly is comfort we,1
Really flattering cut  this shirt is perfect for fall. got so many compliments the first time i wore it!,2
I can't get enough of this dress! this dress is everything. from the flattering fit  to the colors and pattern  to the design  and to the quality.. this dress really has it all. this is worth every penny and in my opinion  a great price for a versatile  high quality dress. the material is that super comfy  stretchy material which is perfect for everyday! it is a no brainer and easy to throw on. i'm so happy it comes in petite as the xsp length fits me perfect! it hits at the perfect length for a,2
Super cute  flattering design but the material is itchy so it's going back:(,1
This product was offered in a pink color which compliments many color palettes. perfect for layering.,2
I tried on the pink version  really nice  the fit is loose  but flattering. opening at the neck looks nice either tied or not. fabric is airy. it looked nice tucked in or with a wide leg pant. i passed only because the color wasn't as bright as i need for my pale skin. overall  very nice.     xs fit at 115 lbs  30 dd  26.5 in waist,2
Ordered this as a gift.  she said it is great!  nice fabric  great fit.,2
The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.,0
This dress is a nice twist on a luncheon/work dress. can pair with blazer or sweater  and it looks really cute with hair styled up - almost throwback.    zipper sometimes gets a little caught on the lace top  but overall i'm really happy with this dress!,2
"I was obsessed with this dress/jumpsuit after i read all the great reviews  even tho i had never seen it in person. it was already on sale and sold out online  so i called a bunch of stores and finally was able to track one down in the navy colorway in my size (it's tts). so glad i made the effort! it's as great as everyone says it is. i love how it's ""party in the back."" i'm 5'3"" so it was pretty much floor length on me.",2
"This romper is so cute and comfy! the fabric is soft and a beautiful shade of blue with light blue dots (true to the photos). i sometimes have issues with rompers due to my long torso  but this fits great  with shorts hitting about the same as the model image (i'm 5'7""). i really love the v-neck on this too - it's simple  but a really flattering cut that i don't think would expose even ladies with a larger chest. definitely a nice everyday piece - excited to wear it on a hot summer day at the pa",2
When i first saw this online  i knew i had to have it. so  when dresses were 25% off  i grabbed the deal! it's perfect. it's super soft and an appropriate length. i love the bell sleeves-they're ultra feminine and slightly trendy  but not too much! i definitely recommend this dress! reference: 5'7  140ish lbs--size 27 in jeans  xs/s/4 in tops and dresses and the small fit me better than the xs.,2
Great looking jacket with attitude. the color is more like a faded black or deep charcoal grey. i'm usually a large petite but this is snug in the chest. luckily it's a knit so i can make it work by zipping it partway and leaving the top half open.,2
How can you go wrong with soft cotton top that is neither too snug nor too loose? expect will wear these as layers under when really cold and by them selves in early spring and in the fall. great colors and love the multiple textures.,2
"I chose to ignore the other reviews saying this shirt was too wide thinking that my wider shoulders would fill it out  but that's not the case. the shirt is adorable and soft and cute on  but just too wide around the armpit/chest area and with the horizontal stripes it just didn't look attractive. i would love to try the next size down to see if it works  but the black and white xxs is sold out so back it went. i am only 5'4"" with a shorter torso so the length was fine for me.",1
This jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture  color is very close too. i normally wear a 4-6 top (sometimes s sometimes m). the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms - the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back). i love this jacket though! the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it!,2
I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side  so the garment flows nicely  it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial  heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey  not whi,1
I ordered the cream. the fabric is unique. similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality. you definitely need a cami or tank underneath. its form fitting without being too snug. i like to wear it with distressed jeans  front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle  (my trouble spot) with chunky accessories  belt  necklace and a block heel. it's a little pricey but decided worth it.,2
I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,0
Tried this on in store and it runs very small. i am a size 4  but have curvy hips  so i sized up to a size 6 and i couldn't even button it. i was hoping it was more of an a-line  but it's fit more like a pencil skirt. not very flattering on my body type. overall  cute design  but not for me.,1
I love the pants and it's so soft and they're great. today was the first day i wore them for more than just a try on and i noticed a hole. that's super disappointing but i'm hoping it was just bad luck ;(,2
If you have any curves  avoid! it is not flattering.  the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress.,0
Got a ton of compliments.  great tee with beautiful print.,2
The picture onlin does not do these pant jsutice  it makes them look wide and short. well  that might be why these are percect for me  but on my body type (muscular bottom)  they are awesome. the material is stretchy  soft  and thick enough to keep shape and not show dimples. lvoe the blue and green color  so rich. i am keeping the green as they are more unique. at 115 lbs  i ordered 25p. the yfit perfectly  but my styllsit keeps insiting that they wil lstretch and made me order the 24p. we shal,2
Usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one. i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top. possibly better on smaller chests. the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good. not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs. going back :(,1
I love the style of this dress  but unfortunately  it runs very small. i normally wear a size 8. i ordered a 10 and the dress was closer to a size 6. disappointed that i had to return it. also  the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem.,1
This is a beautiful top. it's unique and not so ordinary. i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest. although i had a baby this year and i am nursing  so that could be why. if i bought again i would size up.,2
I love the sweater online and even more in person! i paired it with a long sleeve top with a bell sleeve and it looked great!! very bohemian look!,2
This sweater has beautiful colors & cute fur collar which can removed (nice).  i bought it impulsively.  when home i tried it on with a tee as sweater is warm. i had to take it off immediately as it is scratchy & itchy.  i could not wear this without a long sleeve tee underneath  but i would be too warm.  in the store  several sweaters had thread runs in them and from the weight of the sweater.  given the itchiness and potential to run  i am returning the sweater.,1
"I was on the fence about getting this maxi because it's a tad pricey but ended up scoring an retailer coupon that took a bit of the sting out of the price. i'm so glad i went ahead and ordered it! it's absolutely lovely! i'm 5'3""  117# and got an xs petite; it fits like a glove and is the perfect length to wear with either flats or a higher heel. love  love  love!",2
I love joggers  best style to come along in awhile. i think these are well made and i like the fabric. i just wish the leg were cut a bit slimmer but that's just a matter of preference. i definitely like them and will keep and wear.,2
Love these wide-leg chinos. they are super comfy and the fabric is incredibly soft. the size fit true for me. i would buy these again.,2
Beautiful design and fit.,2
I ordered the xxs petite (only size in petite left at the tme0 and that was right for me. i usually (should say used t) get xs but with the looser styles lately  xxs seems to fit me better. hte leg hem falls below my knee  but not too low on the calf. the waist is comfortable  hte weird part is the fabric  the sash part seems to be lighter and the softer part is on the inside so it would seem.    for reference  i am 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.,2
"I really love this dress but i am still struggling with keeping it or not. i have an hour glass figure with a somewhat fullish behind :). it is tight around that area which i think it is meant to be but i am not sure how comfortable i am with that. i wasn't sure about the belt but it really works. i am 5""3 and weigh 118. i did have to size up from 2p to 4 p for it not to feel too tight in all areas.",2
I purchased these bottoms with the matching peplum top in romantic floral. i also purchased the higher waisted bottoms just in case.   i returned the higher bottoms and that's saying a lot.   i have two sons and now struggle with fit in regard to two piece bathing suits.   the higher bottoms just didn't fit right and i didn't need the extra coverage because these fit so well and the peplum gives extra coverage  though not really necessary.   the others cut in a bit in the seat and hips and these,2
Love love love this pair of underwear (yes  i'm writing this about underwear). they're comfortable  flattering  and no vpl (visible panty line) without having to wear a thong.,2
I was disappointed in this vest  it was stiff and scratchy and seems too big  doesn't drape well fromm the armpit and bust line area. not very figure flattering  looks like i put a blue shopping bag on and belted it to try to add flair!,1
This has a unique style and feel to the fabric which i like. however  the color is not orange as advertised. it's more or a reddish pink tone which was somewhat disappointing because orange is what i was looking for. i will still keep it to pair with other outfits in mind.,1
I bought this a little ago in the denim color. it has become a favorite so much that i bought another in white.,2
I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing  the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash  too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.,2
"I am so happy i splurged and bought these jeans. based on the other reviewer  i ordered one size up  and they fit perfectly. i'm 5'8 and appreciate the longer inseam. i can't wear a wedge heel or anything with them  but with a flat on they skim the floor perfectly. you'll love the raw hemline and the subtle ""wear"" throughout the fabric. it's not overdone. just like in the picture  they really seem to narrow the hip  think page boy style. very  very flattering!",2
"I saw this dress in my local retailer store and had to try it on. i cannot say enough good things about this dress! i love it!   like other reviewers said it runs very big. i am 5'8"" 138 pounds and usually wear a size 6 but got this in a 2. fits like a shirt dress should once i sized down.",2
"The photo of these is truly misleading - they are a beautiful vibrant print - see the close-up photo. they are much longer on a regular person - they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 5'5""there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each (like a pleat) that really allows a nice flow. these look great with boots  flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large. not lined  but drape beautifully. there are pockets (sewn closed upon purchase) and pack pockets.",2
This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and  without a chunky statement necklace  it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn't any style to it - has to go back.,0
120 lbs and i saw this while shopping with my sister who is 125 lbs. we both tried on the small and the fit was perfect. i didnot need a petite. it is so soft and i didnt notice other vests with different fabric from each other at all. the vest is just like the photo. its cozy. collar didn't bother me  i wear my top collar out or with a turtleneck. i waited until it was on sale because the price was a little high. but it is very soft and uniquely special.,2
"This dress is really beautiful  cheerful  the color lovely  the fabric soft and beautiful. i wish it had worked with my body because i really liked the style  fabric  and color. i am 5' 5"" with long legs and a shorter upper body  so i needed to buy this dress in a petite size  but they were sold out of petite smalls and mediums. so i tried the small in a regular size. the armscye (depth of arm hole) is so low that my breast was completely revealed! i thought about shortening the straps entirely",1
I bought this in both colors for it is perfect for me.it looks great with jeans and then dress it up later with pants.this is why i love retailer!,2
I was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures.  although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person  i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs.  the pictures don't really show the extreme brightness of the trim.  it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater.  to me it looked like something a child would wear.  i ordered the 1  which was the smallest size offered.  it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle.,1
Tried on my normal size in the store and i was swimming in it. the sales associate suggested i order the petite in store. perfect! i just wish there were more opportunities to try on petite sizes in store. this coat is soft and roomy. when it's buttoned up it has a great shape too.,2
I purchased this blouse in my usual size xl. the wine color is very nice  sort of a rusty cranberry. i so badly wanted to love this blouse but i have to return it. there is so much fabric in the back that it makes me look like a giant cranberry. it is not flattering at all on my full figure. maybe if i was very slender  the massive volume of fabric wouldn't matter but sadly it needs to go back. on a side note  this is a cotton blouse and i believe it is going to require ironing since i badly wri,1
Thank goodness i looked at everyone's reviews beforehand because i ordered a size up (4) and it fits perfectly. i am usually a size 2 but can definitely tell it wouldn't have fit correctly had i ordered a 2. the orange color works well for either a fall dress with leggins or a spring dress by itself. i love it!,2
"I bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed. i'm 5'7"" and slim. it was matronly. i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better? the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose. the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt. keep that in mind if you do buy. pretty",1
I tried this on in the store in the xs size. the pattern is striking and really makes you think of all the things you love about fall. having said that i did not buy it and probably won't unless i find it on the sale rack later. it is really more of a poncho than a sweater. the fit is very oversize through the body and i tried the xs size. it is also fairly cropped on me as i am tall. i would only wear it with a shirt underneath. the sleeves and not attached to the shoulder  but start further do,1
"Ok  so the shirt is ""dry clean only""  however  i like it so much that i'm not going to knock out a star in the rating. the quality is really nice and it was not too short for me ------ i could reach up without worrying my stomach would be exposed. i'm 5'6""  36c and 125 lbs  and the size 6 was perfect. wonderful for work and also great with jeans. i know it's a little pricy  but it's cute and unique --- plus right now it's 25% cheaper.",2
This dress looks so beautiful on the model and i couldn't resist ordering it on-line. i have an athletic build -- read small hips -- straight. i'm 5'5' and 135 lbs. i was very disappointed when i put on. it's made for a curvy build. the dress was just too big  especially around the hips. i think this dress is probably beautiful on a curvier build!,1
I cant say enough about this top. the material is soft and comfy . very well made. the length and  size is spot on! looks great tucked in or out! very versatile. highly recommend!!,2
"Great  rather heavyweight  long cardi. i purchased the blue  which is a lovely shade of gray/blue  not quite as bright as the picture depicts. pin is adorable; doubt i'll ever use it to close the sweater  but still a nice touch. for reference i'm 5'5""  136 lbs  34ddd and typically fall between size small and medium. took a medium in this one and glad i did. perfect fit. falls exactly like on the model.",2
I love this cover-up. it does feel big when you first put it on  however  you just pull on the strap and tie it to your liking. i am 5'2  so this hits a little lower than on the model in the picture  but it does not drag on the floor. this is my new favorite cover-up. now  all i need is the sun!,2
I tried this on in-store and would have purchased if it have been a better price  it wasn't something i could justify spending $100 bucks on. it's cute and was surprisingly comfortable but again  not worth the asking price. i will buy when it goes on sale.,2
I've never owned sweater leggings before so these were my first. i had to order large because well i have some junk in the trunk (am 10/12 on bottom and 8 on top). these are a teeny bit scratchy but i'm hoping with a wash they'll soften up--but they're really loose too so i'm also hoping they'll shrink a teensy bit.,2
I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me  but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall  it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender  i think this top would work!,0
Runs true to size but some details were not as expected. the slit is only on one side and the look is more like sweater dress than sweater tunic. the length is not as long as pictured on the model. i'm 5'7 and the sweater ends half an inch below knees. the side slit starts too high  my waist is exposed unless i wear high waisted leggings. other than that the sweater is darling. the cotton (68%) and acrylic (32%) thread is soft and thin  not bulky at all. the sweater stretches lightly with wear a,1
Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn't. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn't have enough shape. had to send it back.,1
"This dress has a charming ""carefree"" look that invites fall.",2
This is a super cute tank- fits good  flowy and airy which is exactly what i had in mind for summer. fits good.,2
"Bought this for my brother's wedding and i just received it. i ordered my usual size xs. it's a tightly woven knit  with little to no stretch in it. i could barely get it over my head and my arms could barely fit in the sleeves. and i don't have big arms at all. for reference  i'm pushing 5'7""  around 125 lbs. i'm glad it's so structured because i was worried that it would lose it's shape with this material make-up. but  no. it's really fitted. alas  i need to try again with the next size up. ma",1
I have been searching my entire marriage -- 11 years -- for the perfect christmas and valentine's day dress. it had to be red  it had to be the right red  and it had to be my style. there were several i saw over the years that were either too burgundy or too matronly. when i saw this dress  i knew my 11-year search was over! this is the most beautiful and elegant  red  special-occasion dress i have ever seen! i cannot wait to wear it for christmas! i think retailer should have reordered thi,2
Lovely  lovely dress  great quality. unfortunately runs rather large at the hips. i wear a size 2 and the xs fit well in the chest but large at the hips.,2
This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute  not flattering  the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend  although it looks airy and comfy.,0
Love this top!!!! it is just gorgeous and fits great!,2
I love the tie-dye look! i ordered the blue color in my usual size small. fit is tts. love it!. just a fyi: 1. on mine  one arm is a darker blue tie-dye  the other is very light (color variation). 2. the white band on the mock-neck doesn't give much  so be careful when putting on/taking off.  i think it's pricey  but ordered during the promo so that made it better. it came yesterday  put it on w/ my washed blue skinny jeans  out to dinner we went!,2
This is a very pretty color. loved the flow and the length of this top. however the neck hole seemed too small for the top. all the embroidering is at the neck and makes that part very stiff. going back,1
I ordered this jacket to complement the larkin dress by moulinette soeurs  which i planned to wear to a funeral. the pair together were perfect. the jacket added just the right touch in fashion and practical warmth on a sunny but chilly february morning in alexandria  va. i ordered my usual size and it fit perfectly  if not a tad bit large. but then i'm not very tall so occasionally items have more material than i need. but i never worry about that since it doesn't usually affect the lines of th,2
This dress must be pinned on the model in the picture. i ordered a small although i really needed a petite small  but it was sold out. it is incredibly billowy. very billowy. i love the print and the material but this dress is just so very voluminous. i may have it professionally shortened since i am only 5' and the dress hits just below my knees. i'm hoping that helps since i'd really love to keep it.,2
I was hesitant to buy this because some reviews said that if you were busty it would fit tight and awkward across the chest.. i'm petite  32c  5ft and purchased the xsp in white .it is gorgeous! it fits a tiny bit big and i think i could have gotten away with a xxsp  but i like the flowiness of this size i have so i'm keeping it. it does not feel tight across the chest at all and hangs beautifully. i love it! the material is gorgeous and it is well made.,2
So i was super excited to get this skirt  unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured  it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier  i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re,1
"Holy cow! i just got a new bathing suit so i cannot splurge again  but this is flattering!!!! i like the more tame colors which doesn't scream ""look at me"" (let's be honest  there are certain times of the month where we'd rather crawl in a ball and hide). the design along the sides is absolutely flattering and slimming on anyone. i also like the skin-tone/coral detailing around the top of the breast that extends all the way around the back. retailer is really winning with their swimwear thi",2
This dress had an odd fit. very loose on top with pointy darts  very tight on bottom. fabric was stiff so it didn't move well with me,0
Frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top. i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out. but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy. and it has an attached camisole  but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap. so i don't even know what to wear under it. it's going back  even with the sale price.,0
Was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with. for the price of the dress  it felt very cheap. i didn't even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging. the colors were not as vibrant as the picture. as another reviewer mentioned  it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk. very disappointed and will be returning.,0
I love these shorts!!!! i usually have a really hard time finding shorts that fit my pear-shape  but these are great. i bought in a few different colors and i definitely will get a lot of use out of them this summer!,2
I got this top in white and absolutely love it. the top can be tucked in or worn out  it is very elegant and will go well with skirts as well as pants and even jeans. can't wait to wear it.,2
"I loved this trench on the web site  i couldn't wait until it arrived and was even happy to pay full-price to get it! it unfortunately just didn't complement my 5'2"" 135 lb curvy figure as i had hoped. it was definitely much fuller on the bottom which added unnecessary bulk. i have narrow shoulders and it was snug and uncomfortable with a simple tank top on. i hung it in my closet for a few weeks  tags intact  continuing to try it and each time it just wasn't working. it also had many stray thre",1
Very soft  comfy  lightweight sweater. perfect for layering as the weather gets cooler. looks great with jeans or jean shorts.,2
I splurged on this dress when it was first in stock a year ago and haven't regretted it for a minute. it is my go to dress for work  cocktails  and once  two weddings in one day! the print is gorgeous and the fabric is super comfortable. i love twirling in it as the dress has just enough stretch with a little flounce. the length is ladylike and the sleeves provide perfect coverage for my arms. the seam between the bodice and the skirt hits right at your natural waist and the look really flatters,2
It's a beautiful skirt. the color is vivid and the skirt is flattering.,2
Very soft and comfy tee. like the interesting neckline. wish the petite neckline was slightly higher  but sleeves are right length and have great cuffs.,2
"I opened the package and loved this skirt immediately. i held it up and the waist is tiny. i'm usually a size 6 but sometimes go for a size 8 at retailer (i'm 5'6"" and 126 lbs). i would have needed at least 4 extra inches in the waist band to close the zipper...i wonder if this is a british size 8 or something. this 8 is closer to a 4. really disappointed.",0
"I ordered this dress in both a petite xs and regular xs and the petite fit the best. for the first time in my life i did not have to shorten a maxi dress and i am 4ft 10""!   the color is a beautiful dark blue( not sure why the color online says charcoal) and the opening at the chest area is a little low  but nothing that double sided tape can not fix.  another bonus  as other reviewers have stated   is that you can wear a regular bra. lastly it does not wrinkle  so you can bring this on vacation",2
As another reviewer wrote.. this is not the same jean featured on the website. same cut and style but it's a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees. i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them. i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure.,1
This vest is the one thing i will wear all year round. i couldn't wait for this to arrive  it looks and fits just like the pictures. great quality and value  is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit. i have worn it several times and  in addition to looking great does keep you warm.,2
Ugh. i wanted to love this dress so much. i ordered it for a fall wedding and was so excited about it. unfortunately the cut is so very different from how it is pictured on the model. the color and print are the same  the detailing around the next are even more beautiful than pictured. the length  however is so much longer then pictured. and it's not just an issue of the model being tall. the slip is the perfect length (and it's actually the perfect slip)  but the overlay comes down way past my,1
1. this looks so cute on the model  doesn't it? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants  but it looks cute.  2. that said  keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall. i'm 5 feet 6 inches tall  and this jacket came down to my knees. i'm not kidding. the 3/4 length sleeves were at my wrist  so more like 7/8 sleeves.  3. i'm normally a size 12 in cartonnier jackets  but this only comes s  m or l. the medium is really a size 10  which was too tight across the shoulders and,2
I can't believe how small this thing runs. beyond small. it's almost insulting because the dress is just so gorgeous you really want it to work  but there's no way it's going to when the l is actually a s. so sad to return this beauty.,1
I'm always on the lookout for pieces that look polished  but aren't fussy. this is *that* blazer. i'm rather petite and bought the xs  though wish they had the petite in store to try on as xs is not very fitted on my frame. the perfect weight for 65 degree summer days.,2
"Had been eyeing this for a while. print is beautiful in person  just as pictured. tts fit (size 8  5'7""  150#  pear shaped). comes within a couple inches of my knees so long enough to wear to work.",2
Very pretty dress but the fit is not great. i have to get help to take it off because it's tight in the shoulders.,1
I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants.,2
This henley has a lot of very nice details (lace  embroidery). the material is soft and a little bit sheer (more so in the lacey sections). it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking. the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltage..but there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration (you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only). this irks me a bit  because i would like to button the sh,2
"This may be the most beautiful top i've ever purchased from retailer!  gorgeous  classy  comfortable and one-of-a-kind!  i wish there were another pattern available so i could buy it.  runs large; buy a smaller size than you usually wear.  you will feel chic and confident in this flattering top.  i wear it on the shoulders; a perfect ""10""!",2
I must be the lone dissenter  but i am in love with this piece! a dark cami underneath really make the eyelet pop. i probably would not have liked it if it did not have the clasp  as it does run wide. however  with skinny jeans or slim pants  this works b/c it's loose in the right ways. it may not be for everyone  but it's one of my faves right now.,2
I love the unique design! the details are wonderful. it runs a bit large but it works. a great piece.,2
"This top is another winner from left of center! i love swing tops and this is just adorable. fitted through the sleeves and top portion  it drapes nicely in a very flattering way without looking ""maternity"". i love the rayon on the upper back which adds interest and a slight contrast. i purchased it in the gold color which is beautiful and the fabric is light and very comfortable. in my opinion it runs large. i'm usually a sp but ordered an xsp for a more fitted look but it still looked big for",2
I love this top. i ordered it online thinking that it would be a comfy top for the weekends and i was right. the front is a heavier fabric than the whisper thin tops and yet the back is a wonderfully lightweight cotton handkerchief feel. i am petite and it fits great.,2
This is one of the lowest quality shirts i have ever received from retailer. i was so excited for the shirt  it looked so pretty and soft in the pictures. the flax is very scratchy  marring the softness of the rest of the fabric. the top half is totally sheer  requiring a cami. the shirt is cut in such a way that it flares out from the rib cafe in an unstructured way  unnecessarily adding visual pounds. finally  the sewing is done very poorly and the the side tag is literally three inches long--wh,0
"I like the pointelle feature in the front. i end up wearing a lot of black  but this at least gives me the option to do a bit of color underneath if i so chose. i've worn this with white  black and blue jeans w/ boots. looks great. i'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs. i got a medium  but i could have possibly gone with a small. my only complaint is that it might be a tad bit too long. since i'm on the shorter size  i can't imagine it would be too much of an issue for others.",2
I got this sweater in navy and it is much cuter than online! it is a great transition sweater and also i can see it used on cool nights at the beach. i have worn in professional environment to work as well as with a tee and jeans. i love it!,2
"I purchased this top in the white and love the contrast between the stripes and floral pattern around the neckline. it fit perfectly  however i'm concerned that it might shrink because then it would be too short. i am 5'3"" tall  120 lbs. and small busted. it draped really nicely. small would give me a little more length but may be too loose.",2
I love this top  wish they had it in more colors  i would buy more!,2
"Love the soft fabric and easy fit of this dress. i'm pleased that it does give a hint of one's figure and doesn't just hang like a sack. i found the blue to be most flattering and was playing with styling at home and found that the wider retailer ""tabby"" leather belt gave it a whole new look.",2
I ordered this in an xl and when i pulled it out of the bag  it seemed huge. (i wear both l and xl  depending on the sizing) when i tried it  it did look like the photo - it's meant to be a little voluminous. the arms were a little snug  so sizing down was out of the question. it looks great tucked in to a pair of flair jeans. i gave the asthetic four stars because of the design  which is just a teeny bit off. the lace is delicate too  btw  so care will be needed not to snag it.,2
"I read the earlier reviews on this  and though i agree that the photo here does not show how wide and swingy the top is  i love it! it is so adorable and comfortable. i bought the petite s  and i am 5'2""  118 lbs. it fit true to size in the shoulders. the petite hits just a few inches below my waist  so you might want to keep that in mind if you do not want it to be this short. the sweater part is soft  not itchy  and the poplin sleeves and ruffle are crisp but soft as well. because this is very",2
This dress truly is a work of art and i am becoming a little obsessed with byron lars' clothing line. this is my 3rd dress by him and i have been a size 2 in the other dresses. the 2 does fit in this dress but it is a little snug. not sure if a 4 would look as good because it is meant to be form fitting. the panels trick the eye into making you look thinner too. my dimensions 32c 26 33. it fits perfectly in the hips and waist but is tight on top.,2
I really wanted this. they had two size small in my local retailer  both were damaged. so disappointing. i don't want to pay shipping for one that hopefully isn't damaged:( in the last year i've had multiple quality control issues with retailer. makes me gun shy. not sure i'm getting what i pay for anymore.,0
The colour is gorgeous but it's basically a baby doll dress - it looks like the waist is much lower on the model but for my height and large chest it' fell like a baby doll or a maternity dress. not flattering. pockets are a nice touch though.,0
This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own. i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway. the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable  yet cute. i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique  yet whimsical swimsuit style.,2
"I love this top! the colors are beautiful & look incredible with jeans as well as so many of the different color pilcro pants in my closet. it's the perfect between-season item.  since i don't like garments that have a ""boxy"" fit  i was concerned that this top wouldn't work for me after reading some of the other reviews. but it looks great & feels comfy.",2
I just received this beautiful dress in the mail after ordering my usual size petite 12. words can't describe how beautiful the fabric and embroidery appeared as i pulled the dress from the box. i quickly tried it on. the length was perfect. but when i attempted to zip the side zipper  i realized that i would never be able to zip it up over my size 38c chest. the bodice is simply too small. sadly  i have to return the dress. this is my biggest disappointment from retailer so far. if you have a ver,0
This top looked really cute. when i received  it the fit was not flattering. it is snug on top and very loose  on the bottom with an excess amount of material. it made me  look very disproportionate. i returned it.,0
"These chinos are really soft and comfortable  but they run really large. i have the 27 petite (5'4"" 115 lbs.) and they are too big. i originally bought the 28 petite and exchanged them for the 27 and after wearing the 27s all day i have realized they are significantly too big. they stretch as you wear them so they ended up completely saggy in the butt and hanging around my hip bones. i was in the store today and tried on a pair in 26 regular and those were also too big; i didn't have time to try",1
These legging are adorable. i love that i was able to get them in a petite size and the detailing of these pants are awesome. the buttons at the ankle are cute. i truly feel these leggings are worth the price i paid for them because normally i don't like to spend so much on leggings.,2
I absolutely love this dress! it's a great summer dress that's flirty and fun. i feel this dress runs pretty true to size except in the bust area. the buttons at the top pull a little bit on me unless i wear a bra that pushes the girls up and together. i'm a 32ddd just so you have an idea. i'm 5'10  about 145-150 lbs and i'm a 4-6. in dresses i'm usually able to get away with a 4. i have a bigger bust and bum but a super  tiny waist. i'm just barely able to get away with wearing a 4 in this dres,2
This dress is so flattering and just beautiful in person. love it!,2
Excellent quality! i love this camisole with it's muted shades of black. based on other reviews i sized down from my usual 4 to a size 2 and the fit was perfect and no problems with the straps being to long. a keeper!,2
I tried on about 25 items in the store today and didn't buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral t-shirt (i may have to go back for it). the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt. the fit is exceptional as well- not too loose or too snug. i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price.,2
"Love this shirt. i am 5'2"" and 115 lbs. i am normally a pxs and got the pxxs and it got perfect! my new favorite shirt.",2
"I adore these jeans! i bought them in a size 31 but probably could have gone with a 30. i decided to keep them anyway and have been very pleased. the fit is flattering. the color is perfect! i prefer these gray jeans to any other color for most outfits. the waist is a little higher than i'm used to  but that makes the fit even more flattering and helps prevent the ""sagging out"" issue that my older paige skinny jeans have.  i love these jeans and definitely recommend them for hourglass shapes. mo",2
I am on the fence on this one........it's quite beautiful as color goes  the pic online seems rather faded. i just felt it was a bit wider on the bottom than might be flattering otherwise. beautifully made and the fabric is of great quality.   i just i wish some of these tops were in better proportion from top to bottom  and less bulky.  other than that i still may purchase as the print is beautiful..........,2
This is a darling white top. the juxtaposition of the simple front and the beautiful lace back makes this a unique piece. definitely size down.,2
I agree with the others...this is the type sweater that hooked me on retailer ten years ago. i love my new sweater. i do recommend wearing a long sleeve tee underneath. the sleeves are itchy.,2
"If you are like me and your shoulders are broader than your hips  the boat-neck on this won't be too wide on you. ---------- i am normally a m or l in retailer tops  and went with the m  and i have very large biceps. if you're broad-shouldered but have smaller arms  i would recommended sizing down a size. ---------- i have a very long torso and didn't find this to be too short...but i love jeans with a 10"" rise. if you are going to pair this with low or medium (8.5"") rise jeans  then yes  you will",2
I made a visit to the store specifically to try on this dress and it was a disappointment for me. i tried on size 6 regular (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips) and i could not zip the dress up half way. the zipper is on the side  but it's more to the back which i have to stretch my arms all the way back to reach it. it stopped at my waist and was too tight for me to zip up anymore. i tried on an 8 regular and the entire dress was huge. (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips). i like the regular size because the l,1
Based on reviews  i was concerned that this dress would not fit in the chest area. however  i find that i have ample room there (i am a full c). it is a tiny bit tight in the waist  but not uncomfortable or unflattering. i will go ahead and say that it runs small for that reason. the straps are a little long on me and will need to be taken up. also there is no zipper so getting it on and off requires unbuttoning the buttons  so it's not fast.     overall quality is very nice and it is very prett,2
Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high  and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around  it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2  but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt  i'd be totally in love.   as it is  i'll be returning it.,0
Knitted & knotted are my new bff. their sweater dresses are amazing and i'm now tracking down sold out versions of their apparel to enhance my closet and have a party. i adore (and drool...just a lil bit) this dress. the colors and styling and warmth make me happy. i sized up to a l because of my linebacker shoulders/broad bust (thanks retailer user reviewers!) i am comfy as long as i don't flail or flap. my one teeny tiny little complaint is right out of the factory cellophane bag  i had a loose,2
This was on display when walked into my local retailer  it's just a beautiful in person. my mistake was trying it on  instant love! i tried on my usual size small & it fit perfectly. i would usually wait for something in this price range to go on sale  but i just had to have this. worth the splurge!,2
Product is sheer  but definitely adorable w/ any jean product! wouldn't pay full price but so glad i got it on sale w/ extra savings!!!,2
Love this shirt. i am 5'8 and have a slender torso and the small fits perfectly. i love that it's long so you can wear it as a single shirt or use it as an extra layer. i also have a grey druzy necklace to dress this puppy up. purchased it in black and this will be a new staple.,2
This is a great piece  you can do many things with it. i wore it to work and church :),2
I bought this on sale. the cools on the bird pattern are beautiful and i liked the detail on the sleeves. a little see through  but ok with a nude bra or tank underneath.,2
I am waist-challenged. i like a narrowly cut structured sheath dress  sort of like the 60s styles. this is a great dress either belted or loose with great accessories and lovely shoes. it has so many colors in the pattern  you can wear this with anything  and the fabric is so high-end and quality that you can definitely wear this to work with a jacket and then change into a denim or leather jacket and tough high boots and go out for the evening in the fall-winter. it arrived in the mail and righ,2
This cute dress was very nice on. however my only reservations were the thickness in the arm sleeves. the dress has this thick curtain like material on the sleeves that seemed to big and cut way to wide for my skinny arms. i thought about bringing this to the tailor but i feel it would be a lot of work and the bulkiness of the arms would just be the same.  other than that the colors and dress are beautiful.,1
I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made  but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris  these were cartoonishly wide.  needless to say  they were returned.,1
I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however  this shirt is so unstructured and oversized  i might as well worn a brown paper bag.,0
"Ref: 5'4""  125# 27/4  32g. i don't think this is for us shorter women. this hits you right where you don't want a vertical line to hit. it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are. the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn't even dream of making this work. i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me! glad i tried in-store and didn't online order.",0
Love these pants -- the colors  style  fit. however  this is the second pair of retailer active pants i've ordered that i've discovered had a hole in them. these are not cheap pants  so the poor quality is inexcusable.,1
I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans  as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans  they fit very well. however  for the price  they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose  even after 20 wears,2
This romper is so flattering. i normally don't like how short rompers are  but this fits and flares at the perfect spots on me. not to mention that it's super comfortable. i wore it last weekend and got a ton of complements. very happy i bought it! i normally wear a medium  but the small fit me perfectly?i'd recommend sizing down.,2
I bought the orange version during the tag sale and was so pleasantly surprised when it arrived. it fits very well and is made from thick  high quality material. i only wish they had more colors!   sizing--i bought the 2p and it fits well  although a 0p may have fit better. the dress is fairly low cut on me  although i am small chested  but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing it to work.,2
I love shift dresses and i love t linen so this one was a must for me. i had it in my inbox as soon as it came out on the website and then i found it in the store and had to try it on. i took the six and the eight to the fitting room because i run in between  and the six fit better so i guess it runs a little bit large. really it just depends on how you want it to fit. the length is great too  about 3 inches above my knee  i'm 5 foot 5  which is exactly where i like my dresses to hit. i got the,2
"I think these are amazing for anyone over  say  5'5"". the way these hung on me (at 5'2"") were very unflattering in the front. they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them. that's all i can say without being crass.",1
I bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it. it came out of the wash (delicate/cold cycle) with 3 small holes. i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer. it is flattering  lightweight  gorgeous color  cool raw edges  v-back detail...i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top  but now it has holes after one washing so it's all for naught. do-over please with better fabric qa.,1
Very cute but a little short. currently pregnant so i'm hoping it will hang better in a few months,2
I bought the ivory in my usual size xs and the fit is flattering and quality is good. it is a good weight for spring  summer and fall. i love that it is a natural cotton/linen blend. the turquoise was not available in my size initially but when it restocked for a short time i ordered it  also! i know i won't be disappointed. beautiful sweater with great details.,2
I love this. it is perfect. it is sheer  but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great. so glad antro finally has something with a waist! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail. i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one!,2
Saw this in the store and had to have it. i got the green because its different. i am typically a 4 or xs in most dresses  sometimes a small. i bought the small in this dress until i realized it was a little too loose. if you like that look  the small could have worked too.the xs didn't look like a bag on me and could be dressed with a belt for a more fitted look. i like the knee length and fabric is super soft. definitely recommend!,2
I tried on the petite in the store and loved it it's just the color kind of washes me out a bit... nut i did love hte fit and style...,2
I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips  buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then  size up.,0
I love the dress overall  however  found it a tad snug in the bust area. overall  a beautiful dress to own.,2
I purchased this sweater in black to dress up my everyday cardigan. this is very soft and can dress up a skirt or great with jeans.,2
I am so pleased with this midi dress; i've already worn and laundered this dress multiple times and i cannot express how comfortable and cute this dress is to wear. best of all  the fabric is just substantial enough that there are no posterior lumps or panty lines that are visible and the v-neck is just low enough to provide a subtle sexy dã©colletage. i love the length of this dress as i really dislike my knobby knees and this exposes enough leg from the sides and disguises the ugly knees for me,2
I recently bought this blouse  the soft fabric drapes nicely and the stitching is wonderful. love it!,2
"I got 2 of these dresses  one in the navy with small flowers and the gray/yellow print. i am 51 and the navy looked a little old fashioned on me. i think if you are younger it would be super cute. the gray/yellow diagonal stripe is super cute! it's a more modern design in the fabric and i love it. it will be my favorite go to dress for the summer. i also think it will pack nicely for trips. i am 5'7"" and wear a small or medium with retailer clothes and i got a small in this dress and it's p",2
Runs very large. ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller,1
This top came in the mail today and did not disappoint. it feels very light and luxurious and the color is just divine. i got the deep red color and it is beautiful. it can be dressed up or dressed down. i ordered my usual small and it fit tts.,2
I have a different perspective than the other reviewers. the fabric is thin - and silky -perfect for summer! it is a pleasant change from other items in my summer closet. i bought the small  which i typically wear. it can easily be dressed up with heels and down with flat sandals. finally  it has pockets!!!!,2
"This sweater is the reason i shop at retailer - unique  cute & comfy! the yellow really isn't 'one of my colors' but it's so different that i had to get it. and the cut is so flattering  that i had to go back to get the purple! it may run a tad bit generously; i'm 5'4""  124 lbs  34d and originally got the small. i wound up returning and getting the xs. that sizing was slightly more form-fitting  without being clingy.we had a hint of fall weather in colorado  so i immediately threw the yellow versi",2
"Great fit i'm petite and bought size 29. my hips and waist differ by 10""  so i'm very curvy. i love the fit and look just by rolling them up. my 1st pair of ag jeans and i will definitely buy more.",2
This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side  not the front. very unflattering on me.,0
"As previously mentioned  this dress runs very large. i ordered accordingly  and the small was the right size for my frame  but it was just not flattering. i'm pear shaped  and i found the shoulders to be large  the neck a bit too high  and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way. i'm 5'4""  140-ish  and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller  it could've worked. i so wanted to love this  because it's soft and comfortable and cute  but back it goes.",0
I ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination. i love everything about this dress. it's comfortable. the colors are cheerful. the proportions of where the stripes are placed works. but  i have to return this dress. it's too short for what i'm comfortable wearing. i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models. i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me. unfortunately  it's just too short and i'd feel self-conscious. i don't want to deal,2
I love  love love this top. i've bought several over the years and they wash great and are very flattering and comfortable. i always pick up the newest color.,2
These leggings are amazing. by far one of the most comfortable pairs that i own! i should have ordered more. i got a m/l and they fit perfect. the detailing is awesome  and they even stay opaque when you sit  so you don't have to worry about them being see-through. great buy!,2
This top is light and airy  but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach. its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit. i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit. it runs slightly big  but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless. the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special.,2
This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.    the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.,0
I like the warm neutral color of this piece and the figure-skimming shape with waist definition. it is a soft and warm layering piece. sadly  the sleeves were too long for me and have long zippers at the cuffs so rolling them up didn't work. i wish i had caught this piece while they still had my size in petite!,2
Love this tunic. i bought it in black and wore it with skinny jeans and flat black boots and received many compliments. can be dressed up for work or worn with distressed jeans on the weekend.,2
"These pants are attractive but their material is stiff and feels like canvas. i like them  but am not sure that i ""love"" them. perhaps they will get softer with wear  but only time will tell.",1
I have been eyeing these jeans the last few times i have been in retailer shopping but did not really need another expensive pair of jeans. today i finally gave in and tried them on. i fell in love and bought them. i sized down one size. they are so darn cute!! i ended up also buying the pilcro em jeans too. loving pilcro' new cuts and styles lately. the embroidery on these jeans is unique and they are really flattering. already planning to wear them out to lunch with friends tomorrow. highly reco,2
The picture is not a good depiction of what the skirt actually looks like. the colors are more varied and green is the dominant color. it looks great on and the colors compliment each other. i would definitely recommend it as a daily go to item for your wardrobe.,2
The burgundy plaid colors are what caught my eye! so perfect for the fall season. i usually do not like off the shoulder tops as most do not stay down but this one does and as others have stated there are arm stays inside to help with that. i stayed with my usual small to keep the length and it was fine. got compliments the first time i wore it. so glad they restocked in my size  as they had been sold out.,2
First of all  this skirt is as cute on as it is in the picture. very flattering. i am a curvy gal on the bottom and this is flattering. that being said  it runs small. i purchased a large which is my usual size  and i need another inch or two all over to make it work. part of the problem is the material. it is a very heavy  durable upholstery like material. there is absolutely no give to this. it is a very stiff material as well -- more what i would expect on a sofa than on my skirt. the skirt c,2
Love this vest!  just got it in the mail last week and i have already worn it twice with two different looks.  it's timeless and can be worn in so many fun ways!,2
The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul,0
Soft knit  perfectly finished  comfortable and looks great on the model and the previous reviewers' mom.  it just looks too 'empty-nester' for my style (and i won't be until 2035!)  this is a nice base for a creative dresser/accessorizer  which i'm not.  i'm also messy so it's hard to keep ivory clothing coffee free.  i'm glad i tried it on because it proves how great a label knitted & knotted is for quality garments.  just had to pass on this for personal style reasons.,1
This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!,0
This is the perfect dress to transition into fall  either dressing it up with wedges or down with a leather jacket. i have never purchased this brand  ranna gill  but needed to size up which is rare for me when i shop at retailer. it is comfortable and lightweight. i marked it down one star on quality because for the price  i have already noticed some of the black lace stitching coming undone.,2
"This is a nice dress made with high quality fabric. unfortunately i'll need to make a return as it was quite big. i bought this dress in an xs and it was too large all around. i am about 5'3"" and 112 lbs and would have taken the petite  but there were none available. i'm not sure the petite would have even been small enough. the dress was a bit too long for short ladies and definitely too large in the waist and the bust (i'm small on top). it's too bad a this was a cute  and versatile dress that",2
This shirt is very pretty in person  although more orange than it appears in picture. i got it for 25% off the sale price  which was definitely worth it  but i wouldn't have paid more than that. the back has a soft tshirt jersey material with a gray and white print. the neckline is a little weird  gathers kind of strangely  but other than that  a really pretty top.,2
I'm a 110 lb  shorty with a short torso and long arms so the standard xs was huge. i had the opportunity to try on both the xxs petite and xs petite. the xxs petite was almost perfect but i wanted it more flowy - probably best for those that are even shorter and more lightweight than me  othewise  it looks a little too boxy. the petite xs fit me the best and draped nicely  similar to the model in the pink. i had a sweater with this exact silhouette 5+ years ago and wore it to death even though i,2
Love the fabric fit and cut of this skirt. it hits at just the perfect spot but runs a little large and is more flattering when sizing down (atleast on me) .,2
I really love this shirt and bought it in several colors. i wish it came in white and in black because it's a great basic. i think it also works well for business casual attire.,2
Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.,0
"I purchased this in the ""purple"" which is more blue than purple  but you can definitely see the purplish hue depending on the light. it's a beautiful  rich indigo color. it's very comfortable. i usually go for more fitted styles  but i was pleasantly surprised at how flattering this top is even though the body of the shirt is more loose fitting. i'm very excited to wear this top this summer. i haven't worn and washed it yet  so i am hoping the color and material will hold up after washing. i am",2
Thee are beautiful pants. so soft to the touch. true to color. ca.t wait to wear them in the fall.,2
"I got these in the brown and the red in my usual xspetite  and love both. the length is perfect for my 5'3"" height and they're not skin tight  but fit like a glove (i have a 26"" waist and 34"" hips). the elastic inside the waistband can get flipped fairly easily if i'm not careful  but it's easy to flip it back. i think that's the only thing that might stop me from attempting to wash them in the machine against the instructions  which say to hand wash only. i wish they had been made machine washa",2
I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt  but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight  which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.,0
This is a great sweater to wear out over a top or instead of a jacket.the yarn used is super soft and warm. i typically wear a size medium in sweaters and tops and ordered a size medium. it fits perfectly!,2
I ordered the dress on-line. this dress looked pretty  the material was soft and comfortable  the length was perfect  but the zipper was totally out of place. it bulged out in a weird way which made it look like the dress was torn. i had to return the dress. i normally don't see a problem at this level in retailer clothes.,0
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i love the colors and pattern. i've just been on the fence whether it complements my hippy frame. i'm a size 8/10 right now. i do like it with or without the tie for different effects. one concern is that the website says hand wash and the tag on the seam says dry clean only. i usually don't buy dry clean clothes  but might make an exception for this one.,2
Bought this in white and the golden embroidery makes this piece very elegant looking. it is a bit sheer  but with a lace bra definitely very nice. that is the only con  i wish it would be not sheer at all. but it is too beautiful to send it back for that reason.,2
This is a must have for summer. i'm always hot but sometimes a sweater just doesn't look right. the short sleeves are just what i've been looking for. every jacket i own runs smaller on me around the bust and arms  so i think for everyone else  your normal jacket size should be perfect.,2
Love this jacket! really wish it came in real leather as well but can't beat this price point. great cut  fit. and love that the zipper is black. looks like it is worn in leather  most peoppe can't tell that it's vegan!,2
"These tights are so cute  but the sizing leaves much to be desired. i guess they are true to size since they are labeled s/m.  i'm 5'0"" with shorter legs than torso  and i suppose i'm lucky that i have muscular (read: large) quads/thighs to suck up some of the fabric  otherwise these might have just bunched up at my ankles.  the other thing i don't love about them is the feel of the fabric - it's more sweater-like (and not a soft sweater) than stretchy. maybe that was the intent  but i find tigh",1
This dress is made of a wonderful  thick material that is flattering. i think the photo doesn't really bring it to life- it's a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a 3 season dress thanks to the colors. the v-neck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office. it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down. i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck,2
I loved this t-shirt in the gray motif so much  went back to get the yellow:-) both go great with pilcro hyphen chinos. while the fabric is a little thin  it's super soft and just the perfect length.,2
Saw this jacket online and decided to search in store for it! i found it  and although it definitely looks more mustard in the picture online compared to the bright yello it really is  i felt it fit very well! it runs large  i usually am a size 6  however  i ended up buying a size 4 for a more fitted cropped appearance. the material is heavy but made very well  and feels great on! i recommend this blazer for any female that wants to brighten her closet up for spring!,2
The material is thin and of poor quality.  it snagged the first time i wore it. the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated.,0
This is the most beautiful and flattering skirt. it was a bit of an investment piece for me in that i just graduated from college  but i love that this skirt can be worn year round. it is more fitted at the top and then flows out at the bottom  making it super flattering. pictures do not do it justice!,2
These shorts are really cute and are a flattering length. grey color has a silvery look to it. keepers.,2
I'm 5'0 and 114 pounds and got the small petite. i have broad shoulders and am slim hipped. i no longer have a waistline  thanks to having given birth  but this dress really hid that. it gave me a figure! the ruching is super flattering and the material has enough support (with stretch!) to hide any unsightly rolls.  so why did i return it? i did  after all  get many compliments from females while trying it on. they loved the color on my pale olive complexion (i'm filipino with -ahem- blond hair,2
This is a fun  cozy sweater. i feel you can dress it up and use it casual too. i bought the ivory in size s  i'm 5'2''. although i put it runs true to size  it's is a tad tight around my upper arms  not uncomfortable. i have normal to somewhat skinny arms  so i don't think it was my body type. i didn't check other sweaters in the same size to see if it was an isolated case. it is to be worn loose  it has quite a bit of material all around mid to lower part  just fyi.,2
I am tall  so this dress hits slightly above the knee on me. the peek-a-boo detail on the skirt and shoulders is flirty  but still modest. this dress is super comfortable and is going to be a summer staple for me. i also love that this dress is button-down  it is an easy piece to wear for new moms!,2
I ordered this top in white and i was really excited for it to come in! once it once delivered and i tried it on it took me a second to decide if i liked it or not. i think i ordered it a size too big (i ordered a large  i'm usually a medium). it was somewhat boxy  but i think paired with the right pants and shoes it would be just what i wanted!,2
I love these! they are a perfect addition to my fall wardrobe  and just like all other pilcro jeans  they are a great fit and true to size.,2
The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise   the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.  the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials.,1
Looks great! it is more off white/tan then white though,2
Just as pictured  this little top is just too cute! the fit is exceptional  and quite flattering. another very feminine top  and the yellow color is perfect! i love pairing yellow with black  of course...but also with reds  blues...and it looks great with white 'pedal pushers'!!! i think they call them 'cropped' now a days! at any rate...this is a first rate top that i highly recommend!,2
I've been looking for the perfect work-appropriate lace dress (for a casual/creative work environment) for a while  and this was just the ticket! the pointed collar and demure shape add some structure to the feminine lace. i rolled the sleeves to a short-sleeve length just to tone done the cutesy factor a tiny bit more (although the sleeves  worn long  are absolutely gorgeous!). the lace isn't exactly the highest quality lace that retailer has ever used  but pretty nonetheless. i'm 5'5 /125 and th,2
This is one of my favorite retailer dresses of all time. it is soo much better in person and on than the stock photos. very romantic and fun.,2
I love quirky and unique sweaters/ cardigans  and this is no exception. it's not obvious in the photo (at least it wasn't for me)  but the cardigan does have buttons all the way down  and not just at the top  something i appreciated. those buttons  however  are not easy to un-button. the snails are adorable without being childish. i'm 5'4 130lbs  often between a small and medium when it comes to cardigans. i chose the medium for this one  which fit exactly how i wanted it to (a.k.a. sleeves were,2
"Sizing: i'm have broad shoulders/back  36c (34d)  short waist  and i usually wear a m in a knit top. that's what i bought  so i'd say that this tee is tts. it is a little longer in the back than front  but not as a high/low top would be. rather  it's sort of tunic-like in style. i have worn it over leggings with and without a sweater  and the added length covers me. i admit that i'm a tad on the short side at 5'2""  and that i have no hips (straight up and down) and no waist. my shape is an upsid",2
"I absolutely love this top and it looks absolutely fabulous (the first time you wear it). the details are impeccable and you'll get compliments all day long. i paired it with a jean jacket and my favorite ""destroyed"" skinnies for an outing in tx wine country. there are a couple of key things to note. when you pull this top on... mind your make-ups. you can and will get make-up on the collar... and so  apply this shirt on carefully... or your make-up (vice-versa). now  after the fist wear  which",2
This is a fantastic skirt and very flattering. i plan to wear this with boots as shown on the model as well as sandals when it gets warmer. i would say that it does run true to size.,2
I love ag stevie cords! i'm 5'4 and pear-shaped and the 26p fit great  the length and mid-rise are perfect! very comfortable and can be dressed up for casual work environment or down for weekend. the material is a bit thinner and not as soft as versions from previous years but still very nice and perhaps more versatile. wish petite had more color options.,2
This is better than the original tla t shirts from last summer. better quality/not sheer. great fit! i bought both the white and the purple. love tla tees!,2
After reading the reviews i decided to give this a try  but it just didn't work on me. i'm 5'8  smaller on top  and usually wear m in retailer sizes. this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips. also  the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear. not exactly the look i was going for. back it goes.,1
The tee is adorable in the floral print. the fit is true to size  as it is a casual tee rather than overly fitted. the cuffed sleeves are a nice detail. i would have bought this at full price  but it is quite see through in the white/yellow floral. i could easily see my nude colored bra and even my belly button it was so sheer. having to wear a tank underneath this completely defeats the purpose of a cute  casual tee you can just throw on. i was so disappointed that it was so sheer. i think the,1
"Nice vest  pretty olive color  hangs nice but...its just kinda funny. just hangs and really looks odd when tied. i like the laying piece just wished it had more ""umph"".",1
I bought this in store without trying it on. bought my typical size xs. the armholes are cut very low  as is the front neckline. it has an overall slightly slouchy fit. i definitely could not wear this to work without a camisole underneath. otherwise  i really like the style  and the black and white striped color way will go with alot.,2
Color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on. i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine. now for the cons:  it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacock under my arm  which could be seen  i guess  if i waved. the rest were parts of the bird. i would love to have the one in the photos!  next  who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea?  if i had gotten a nice patterned top  i would have replaced the buttons. blouses that i like never seem to b,1
I got one of these tanks  and went back and bought two more online. i have the gray  green and white. the white requires a undershirt for me  but that's no problem. the shirts are darling  they're under activewear and i think they could be used that way  but i definitely don't. they're simple but have a nice flow  and the front and back are perfect. i love the material and the colors. i would buy more if there was more in more natural tones  i don't love bright colors but i love the green  white,2
Perfect fall accessory and transitional piece for cooler days. classic red and black check with a fashion flair. great with jeans or dress it up with jewelry. a great find!,2
This is a very comfy dress/tunic. i like to wear it with leggings. washed well  nice color  looks nice with boots. nice find!,2
I loved this dress...until i washed it. the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry...which i did (washed on delicate). now it's not the same dress. it's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it. i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean  i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved. just kind of annoyed. so it's an awesome dress  just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it.,1
This dress is great. wear now and into fall with boots and leggings. it seems to have structure with the seams and is nicley flowy.,2
This dress is adorable - it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced  in my opinion). the tie detail is somewhat adjustable  and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7  128#). where this gets me is the fact that it's dry clean...totally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer. i might bring it back for that alone  since i originally planned to wear it a lot. :(,2
This dress is so cute and comfy! i purchased it for my friend's wedding brunch celebration - perfect transitional piece!,2
Great quality and beautiful color! i wear size 6 and ordered s. got lots of compliments :),2
Deletta has done it again  designed a top that is unique  flattering  and comfortable. the blue is an intense peacock blue. the only draw back about this top (and with other deletta tops) is that they leave some of the fabric with raw unfinished edges. for this top it is located at the hole the twist creates. it's hidden but i worry about it fraying after a few washes. not sure why they couldn't continue the zigzagging at that opening. perhaps it wasn't cost effective to sew five more inches of,2
Love everything about this dress except - it runs huge.  i am busty and usually wear a 12 in dresses  but the large was completely shapeless on me.  will try medium and hope it is better bc otherwise i love the dress!!,1
"I don't normally like ""lace-up"" details  but for some reason  i don't mind it on this top. it's a bit shorter than it looks on the model (and i'm not especially tall). the fabric is nice - not too heavy  not too lightweight. great for fall.",2
These leggings run true to size. the strappy detail at the ankle is a nice touch. i especially like the quality of the material used as they are not see-through like some leggings tend to be.,2
I love the design and fit and quality. have been looking for a long-line top like this and was willing to pay full price. i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely. smooths it all out. i'm a 38c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top.     here's my issue - wore it once and the colors ran! i was so excited to wear this i didn't even wash the top (i rinsed and dried the bottom  though). and i'm not a swimmer. just let,2
This is huge. i understand that's the style  but it looked like i was wearing my husband's size xxl. i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice... but then it started to itch  and itch and itch!,0
Love the way this looked online/on model. would not recommend for a shorter or curvy person such as myself. it just ended up looking like a very chic potato sack on me  and was not flattering.,0
"This blazer is beautiful. it runs tts. it is lightly lined with an off-white poplin. in the body of the jacket  the off-white lining is an adorable swiss dot. though the lining makes the lace portions of the jacket not completely see through  a darker shirt would still show through. the detail is amazing - from the adorable buttons to the variations in the fabric texture. i am 5'5""  and the fit (as far as length) is very similar to what is shown on the model. the sleeves are a little on the long",2
I swooned over this dress when it first came online. i had never worn a petite size before so i wasn't sure about the fit. i am curvy (34dd-27-42) and normally wear a size 8 dress  but the 6p fit me like it was made for my body. i think this is because the dress runs large  but i really really enjoyed the fit. the quality of the lace is evident immediately and the color is more of a cornflower blue  which i adore. the lace feels like a soft cotton  but has a lot of strength to it. cannot recomme,2
I love the idea of this top  but wish there wasn't so much fabric. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.,2
I wear this vest a lot for it is really cozy and goes with a lot of different types of outfits! it's is versatile and figure flattering. i only buy timeless pieces that i know won't go out of style and this vest fits the bill!,2
Really soft and roomy. very comfortable. just hope it washes well. nice alternative to the regular turtleneck. i wanted it in both colors neutral and green. unfortunately  the neutral did not work for me.,2
I really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste. it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger. really cute style just not sure it's worth the price. great colors though.,1
I originally bought this dress in navy and i absolutely loved it! so i bought a second one in the neutral color. they both fit perfectly and are very flattering! i love how i can dress them up or down. i wear them out to run errands and look cute while being comfy. i also wear them to work! i am an np so business casual is a requirement for office days. when i'm used to wearing scrubs  i hate wearing true dress clothes. these dresses are a happy medium. i only wish my size was available in the t,2
Love the style and cut of this top  but fabric is quite thin. tts if not a tad on the small side. i'm small busted so my usual medium was fine. undecided if i'm keeping this top or not.,2
Love the color (cedar). love the style. sleeves are long and wide but that is the style. biggest surprise is that this sweater is not cropped. the length given in the product info is very short. but when i received my normal size (l) the sweater comes to my hips. just right. the fibers are man-made (acrylic) so that makes this sweater not too warm and not itchy. the weave is close enough that i do not need to wear a cami underneath. when the weather gets colder i will add a nice cami under the s,2
I got this in a l  and probably i am a m. however  the waist pretty much fit  but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust  but a small waist.,1
I initially bought this in the stone color and loved it so much the first time i wore it that i went back for the red. without a doubt my favorite purchases of the season. have gotten so many compliments on both and despite the fact that the style isn't form fitting  it is still somehow very flattering. would highly recommend this sweater to anyone!,2
I ordered this in xl and the fit on me matches the fit on the model. it's meant to be loose & flowy so i think it's true to size. everything matches the photos--the sleeve length  hem  neckline  etc. it's not a slimming look but doesn't make me look bigger than i am either.  the material is a very soft cotton. the pattern of the lace on the top portion is very pretty. there are sequins mixed with the embroidery on the sleeves. the thread they used for those cutout areas is soft. it's washed well,2
Love these pants. the color is a true red and they are very flattering on. i ordered the 6 but they are a little big and i think the pant will give a little when wearing. just reordered the size 4.,2
I got this top in white and it is cute. the fabric is a weird kind of polyester  and kind of shiny. i got the medium and it pulls a little around the chest. overall i like it.,2
I absolutely love each this dress! it is shimmery as others have said but the design looks so beautiful that way and i don't agree that it mages it look cheap. love the neckline and the length is perfect unless you're a petite size. i would snatch this one right up if it weren't for the price point. i'm hoping it'll go to sale but it's so beautiful it might be sold out by then . the fabric seems delicate like he threads could come apart easily.,2
Fits nicely - i'm a standard size 4 most places. also perfect for those in-between occasions. can be dressed up or down and worn with flats or heels :),2
I really wanted to love this coat. it is well made and unique. i usually buy the petite versions but they were sold out. however i went ahead and purchased a regular size because i wanted a second winter coat. sadly  it looked more like a cocoon coat on me. it stuck out at the back. probably because it was not a petite. it pulled across my chest  like shoulders were too short. for reference  i am 5 feet  109lbs  and a 32d. i didn't mind the fluffiness of the top portion and the tie is useful for,1
"I bought these to go with the boiled wool jacket that is also currently on sale. i have several pairs of charlie trousers  and i really like the brand. these are in a thicker ""winter fabric"" and i understand why the other reviews found them itchy. i don't find that bothersome  but the texture is a bit different. the quality is typical for charlies. the color stripe is a metallic bronze  but could look pink in the right light. the fabric is noticeably stretchy--i think without that stretch  these",2
"A fun top!  i tried on both the medium and large (i'm between sizes  5'4""  34g) and preferred the large. the medium waist rode up a bit on my torso  so the large stayed down a bit. also  the medium pleats did not fall as nicely on my chest.",2

I read the other reviews and from the picture it looked as though it may be a little short  so i ordered up to a large. the medium would have fit  but since i'm in my mid-40's i felt more comfortable with large. but if you are trim and young or young at heart your usual medium will be fine. live the material and the navy makes it classy and rich looking. can be dressed up or down. have worn it to a cocktail party fundraiser with blue crop pants and received many compliments. i'm always challenge,2
An excellent going out to dinner  to a lounge  etc. piece. super flattering  sexy  feminine and trendy! can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories. i'm only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits  but this was excellent!,2
Got this dress in the mail today  and i am blown away. the fit is amazing! normally i would get an 8 in dresses  sometimes a 6  i got a 6 in this one and it's perfect. hugs in all the right places. everyone needs this dress! i feel like with the style and fit of this dress  it should be a little more snug so i recommend sizing down. cannot wait to wear this one!,2
I may wear these every day! i am obsessed. i am 5'8 125ibs normally a size 25/26 in jeans. i ordered these in a 26 and they fit like a glove! they do not stretch much at all and keep a really nice vintage fit and feel. i am extremely happy with this purchase. these are a must have staple in anyone's wardrobe.,2
Love this shirt. the print is a little loud  but cute. i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy. however  that was a mistake with this shirt. there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size. i did like it enough to order again in the correct size (l). i am a size 14 and busty  if that helps. the red is short-sleeved  by the way if ordered online  cute and flattering.,2
I have too many grey cardigans. i also have a lot of oversized cardis. but i had to have this one because the stitch pattern is so nice and the yarns are so soft and snuggly. how could i resist? the weave is a bit open work but it still keeps me warm & happy. it also lays in a way that doesn't make me look bulky and top heavy  which my body type already is. i feel sorry for the first reviewer who kept getting subpar sweaters. mine arrived brand new in factory cellophane. i would advise that this,2
Nice sweater  just did not look good on me. sorry  going back.,1
This is one you just need to see in person! stunning  detailed embroidery everywhere  gracefully oversized  very bohemian  light  airy and dreamy. this kimono was mine the second i saw it! white on white is classic...and this cream embroidery is beautiful. the kimono is very oversized. i'm normally a l or xl and this was plenty roomy. it's also quite long. nearly came down to my knees and i'm around 5'8. if there is an option for petite i'd recommend it to shorter gals! can't wait to pair this w,2
This is a beautifully made sweater. i bought this sweater in ivory yesterday; i wore it today and received many compliments. i think the sweater is adorable. it?s soft and warm; the neck is perfect  i like that it?s not as restrictive as a turtleneck. the long sleeves add character and help to make it interesting. i highly recommend it?i?m looking for a black one ,2
Loved this sweater when i saw it online. when it arrived it had a very strong chemical smell to it and was very stiff textured. despite the dry clean only tag i decided to soak it overnight in woolite to soften it and get rid of the smell. the next day i rinsed it in cold water and block dried it outside. it still wreaked of chemicals and took three more subsequent washings to finally get rid of the smell. hand washing did not hurt it whatsoever fyi. it looks fab with jeans and is very comfy. i,1
"This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to ""bloop"" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.  i'm busty  but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered  so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't",0
"After reading the reviews  i ordered this dress in an xs and sp. i'm 5' 3"" and 120 lbs. the xs was too long and too big on the bottom while being too tight in the chest. the sp fits perfectly. i'm wearing this to a wedding and know that i will get lots of use out of it for many different occasions.",2
I love this dress! the colors work well with my olive skin color  it has pockets and it has a hi-lo front/back.â â i have slim hips so the tie waist is very flattering which gives an hourglass figure.â â i am 5?2?  116 lbs and a 32d.â â i usually need a petite size because retailer dresses run a little long on me. but i was able to get away with getting an xs regular because of the hi-lo length. it fell perfectly above my knee.,2
"This dress fits well and is comfortable. my only reflection is that i am 5'9"" and it hits at my mid shin  rather than where it appears on the model.",2
Tried and bought this in the store! loved it. my normal size 4 worked great. little word to the wise  be careful zipping it up  which is a little tricky. the first one i grabbed had a broken zipper. just takes a little work getting it up bc the fabric is thicker.,2
With my 5'9'  hourglass frame  wider hips and having a baby  i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however  with this  i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts: _________ pros: - lots of stretch and comfort. - pockets! always a plus in my book :) - will go with any top. - nice length. fit me as in the model. - very slimming. - you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi,2
This is a lovely cardigan--especially over dresses with leggings  over-the-knee socks  and boots. i was so ecstatic to get it at the black friday price. the description says its white but it's more like a cream. it was for this reason that i initially reconsidered the purchase. i was hoping for more of an off-white or winter white as it appears on the model. except  it looked so great over dresses and suitable for the southern california winter. i didn't care for the wrap belt. it just looked li,2
This jacket is soft  a beautiful color  the perfect length  and incredibly versatile (a fleece jacket that doubles as a blazer) but i was swimming in it! i wouldn't have minded the larger size  but the sleeves looked ridiculous. i wish i'd ordered early enough to try a petite size  but i'm not sure that would've helped. sad to send this back!,1
I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately  this top doesn't suit my long  slim midsection. it is so wide  it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.,1
I waited to review as i ordered both colors and multiple sizes for comparison.    ivory is actually truly longer than the black  i wasn't sure from the photos on line  but having tried both on  ivory is longer (as shown online).    true to size/bigger: i am never sure if i should write true to size or big  but went with the xs petite (used to do everything in xs)... at 115 lbs  30 dd chest  26.5 in waist t ehre was room to move super comfortably. petite for sure for me for both length at the kne,2
Loved the design and legnth but the material was not a light and soft as i expected.  i would get this in another fabric.,1
I found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline; however  the fabric feels cheap and doesn't drape as nicely as i'd hope for the price. this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric. for sizing reference  i'm 5'5''  122 lbs  30dd  and took my usual size xs - though i'm busty for my size  the top provides nice coverage.,1
Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady  but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips  even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try,0
This product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress. it's pretty bad when it won't even zip up on the hanger. such a beautiful dress; it broke my heart!,1
This top is perfect to dress up and dress down. pair it with high wasted pants and you are set!,2
I ordered online and wear xs- m. i ordered a small but it seems big. i have to drive 1+ hour to a store so i do a lot of online ordering. i'm thinking of returning for smaller size. may make a road trip- have several items to return! i hate paying shipping to buy and shipping to return if it doesn't work!,1
Purchased in the blue. the color is a little darker than it shows. more of a slate blue. loved the fit. i am tall so it covered perfectly.,2
Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering.,0
I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve  but the sleeves do not fit loosely  they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms  so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves  but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking  but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy,1
This dress is as cute as represented in the picture. the adjustable ties on the sides allow your dress to be form fitting or a looser  more casual look. the colors of the dress and the beading are beautiful. the dress looks great paired with a pair of black ankle boots!,2
Love this top. the material is so comfy yet it looks dressy. great for a night out with black pants or a skirt. i'm 5ft8inches  38-27-38 and a small fit perfectly which seems true to retailer sizing. flattering yet hides a little post holiday belly. i wore a nude rackerback bra with the top  and that works perfectly with the design.,2
Looks so cute in the picture  but just didn't really look that flattering on - plus the sleeves were too tight and too long for my short arms so going back....,1
I love this dress  i disagree with the review saying it was too sheer. this is a thicker material and doesnt need a slip  it is beautiful and is so comfy. it looks good with heels or sandals. i definately recommend this dress  it would look good on any body type.,2
Love another pair of ag stevie's!,2
Love everything about this. the color is gorgeous - great fall addition to any wardrobe. the tassels are cool - usually don't like things like that.    i wear a small or medium in retailer  usually small  and i purchased the small.,2
This is a great casual summer dress. cute as a cover up but in the black you can definitely wear it for daytime. if you're feeling bare throw on a white button down or chambray.,2
This coat is truly gorgeous in person. it's an investment coat  one that i will probably wear for years to come because the style is timeless and the color is lovely. i found it to be very high quality. in fact  i would love to see more coats of this caliber from retailer. the other reviews had me hesitant to splurge on it  but i don't plan on wearing it buttoned very often so that will be a non-issue for me. the lining is one of the best parts of the coat! show it off! i think the problem,2
This dress is beautiful. fabric is thin but the details are perfect.,2
"I hoped  from the picture  that this would be more of a ""straight down"" sort of fit. retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them. however  the top had too much of a ""flare out"" bell-shaped vibe. i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer  but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those. i think it would only work with jeans/trousers. my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut ",1
This is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big.,2
I love the front of this shirt but i really should have paid more attention to the details of it. i would have realized the front and back are different materials  which i am not a fan of. i would have preferred the entire thing was made of the dressier front material instead of the jersey back. it's like a mullet  business in the front and party in the back. it's got great drape and is a beautiful blue though  so into rotation it goes.,1
One wash wonder...i'm a s to m and went with a m but could have gone with a s with ease. after washing it was way shorter. it shrunk more than a whole size in cold water! i assumed everything came preshrunk but sadly disappointed. great for one wear.,1
"This is a very well made swimsuit with soft foam cups and fully lined. the shoulders stay put with thin strips of foam that are sewn in. very comfortable and easy to move in; my arms have full range. the color is like the online photo  and to the teal close-up i posted of the shoulder area.  .  the size 'm' that i ordered fit my bust very well with smooth lines and decent support. i'm 5'2""  currently 33-25-37  30d / 32c bra  with a average to long torso with a full bottom and thighs. i think the",2
I wore it belted with a close fitting cami beneath because the sweater is open down both sides. be creative and wear it different ways.,2
"As is true of a bunch of the fall clothing photos  the colors are totally washed out in these model images which is such a shame. the embroidery is bright and vivid and totally unique on this! the bib area is actually a soft corduroy which i think is nice to transition into fall and winter. in terms of fit  i do feel like this is maybe geared more towards the slender build - it is a slim cut which i found really flattering for me since i sometimes swim in tunics. at 5'7""  128# with a very small",2
This is a very nice top  but it is very loose and swingy indeed. i sized down one size  and it still is very relaxes. the material is soft  the colors are nice.,2
"I thought this was adorable on the model  but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan  but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs.",1
I absolutely love this sweater....it is perfect for fall,2
This is such a great top that when my cat snagged it i bought a second version to wear in public and kept the snagged version to wear around the house or for working out. it is super comfortable and can be worn with so many things. definitely on the more casual side but you can dress it up slightly w/ jeans and booties  or it can be worn w/ leggings  jeans and tennis shoes  etc. i also bought the coral color in addition to the blue. if you're on the fence i would say you can't go wrong with buyi,2
Love love love...the fit is amazing and truly well made. this jumpsuit is a classic and it fits perfectly. i just wish the button was a little bit more secure but other than that it's a 10,2
Other reviews are right  it is a little short in front. but it's such an adorable dress that i don't care! i love the material. super soft.,2
I fell in love with this shirt in the store and it has become one of my favorite items in my closet! the bright pink contrasts perfectly with the white peplum bottom and the fit is wonderfully flattering!,2
Pretty white pants with nice design at the bottom of the legs. had to have them hemmed a little.,2
"Currently own this in 5 colors after originally buying one. i'm 5'10"" normally wear a medium  bought a small in this. best material and fit overall  perfect length for long torso",2
I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/couldn't even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it's a shame because th,1
I loveeeeeeee this dress! i saw it online and immediately loved the blue/ orange large floral print but so did everyone else and it sold out quick. but i thought the shape could be flattering so i ordered in the black polka dot and loved the shape! so flattering. i ended up going in store and buying the other two colors. the patterns are vibrant and lovely shape. my only concern was seeing it in store i noticed it stretching while just hanging on the hanger. i wish the fabric was of better quali,2
Oh my! this dress fits wonderfully on! so ready for autumn! i have a big bust  this dress does not split at the buttons.,2
I tried on almost every dress in the shop today  and this is the dress. as soon as i tried it on i started twirling around. i felt beautiful and i couldn't stop smiling. my mother said that it makes my blue eyes glow. it flatters my figure by hanging perfectly across my bust-line  floating over my curves  and camouflaging my little unappealing bumps. also  the dress is cut nicely under the arms which allows coverage for a strapless bra. i chose the medium size even though i usually wear a large,2
I wore this dress for the first time yesterday... i have never received so many compliments on a dress before! several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was!  it is an absolute must-have!,2
"I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on. it doesn't look nearly as good on the hanger  so definitely worth trying on. the fabric is high quality and super comfy; the fit is very flattering. i am curvy  5'7"" and got the navy stripe print in size small. it's very forgiving  fitted without clinging to any ""problem"" areas. i also love how versatile it is--you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models  or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings. love it!",2
The dress is beautiful  i wanted to like it and could hardly wait to reveive it. it fits beautifully  and snug except around the arms where it is huge. i could only wear it with a tshirt underneat.,2
This fits great. it looks great with jeans or exercise pants. a little lighter weight than i hoped but looks great  hangs well on my body. i bought the white.,2
I was so excited about this top  as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately  this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit  the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way  due to the layered fabric.     sadly  going back.,0
I like how this jacket is very versatile. you can wear it to work  or play. it does have interesting detail on it  i kept it based on the price and those details. i have the olive color. the arms are a little tight.,2
"Was worried these pants would make my 5'2"" frame appear even shorter  but no  they looked great and fit perfectly. very comfortable. love your pilcro brand  but will remember this brand for the future.",2
I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off  it's about 3 sizes too big. second off  it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.,0
As per usual bordeaux is perfect with this cardigan. very soft  washes well. love it.,2
Dress is darling and well made. however  it runs very large. i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp. would be great for taller slim women. the style is so cute. the online picture does not do it justice.,2
I agree with the other reviews - great dress. i got a ton of compliments on it  but i had to take it to a tailor to get it taken in. not a fan of belts with dresses  but definitely wanted it so had quite a bit taken in. not sure why this seems to be a reoccurring issue with retailer. i was bummed i had to spend money to get the dress to look even somewhat like the photo.,1
"This fits tts.  it is body-hugging as shown on the model.  the knit is thin  soft with tons of stretch.  i bought the ""navy"" which is the color shown in the photo.  as you can see  it's not really navy.  it's a strange blue that's more like a faded dark mallard blue.  but  it's still blue.    the sleeves are long on me. so you taller girls won't have issues.  the ruffles move and are so fun.  the fabric  however  is not finished off.  it's raw cut material  which is why i gave it 4 stars.",2
I love the look and the simplicity of this top! it's very casual  but also super cute. my only issue with it was the fabric started to ball up after a few wears. but i still love it!,2
"This is a pretty adorable jumper. the size 8 would fit someone really well who's about a typical size 6 and maybe 5'6"". i'm 5'9"" and it was too short. it's fun and definitely different. i'd otherwise wear it.",2
"Not sure why this tunic dress is rated only 3 stars. i love it  as i do all coth & stone pieces. and it is cloth & stonw as another reviewer pointed out. the material is great and fit is tts except for the sleeves being just a bit tight. this dress does not run large as do some c&s pieces so don't size down. i'm 5'7""  126 lbs and slender  and the m is perfect. if you have large or very muscular arms  this dress might not work for you. i plan to layer with a thin tee underneath  tights and boots",2
Super cute and flow. mine had a bit of stitching problem so i am exchanging it for the same thing. fabric feels great. def recommend,2
Love this versatile cardigan  have both blue & orange colors & they're beautiful. it's light weight yet cozy. true to size but the sleeves are a little snug so if you like roomier sleeves size up.,2
This skirt is absolutely beautiful in person! the metallic thread is a subtle  stunning addition to this elegant piece. like the last person mentioned  it is thick  but i think it makes it look full rather than like a bag. i think the extra fabric/weight adds a more classic/traditional look to it  making it look more like a wool skirt from the 50s  60s  or 70s. if you're not a fan of that look  you probably won't like the way this falls. like the description says  this is a piece that would neve,2
Amazing jeans!! without pockets on the front there are no weird lines like there are on other white jeans with pockets. the high waist is extremely flattering! perfect for spring and summer!,2
This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat,2
I normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me. the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure  but it at least fit well. the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others. i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me. i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short.,0
I almost bought this tank online  but decided to wait. once i saw it in the store  i knew i had to have it. i bought it in the ivory color  which is perfect. the gold details are subtle  and so pretty. i don't find it too sheer  as some of the other reviews have stated. the cut is so flattering  and it is easy to wear to work when paired with a cardigan.,2
I saw these in the store and was smitten. ordered online and have not been disappointed. love the pattern  the feel  and the fit. comfortable  fun and interesting. the regular length ones are definitely full-length on me but not too long. i might have gone with the petite length except that they didn't seem available  but am perfectly happy with the regular length.,2
This dress is perfect  length right below the knee  white slip lining adds to quality  smocking fits upper body perfectly.,2
First off  this shirt is a hd in paris brand  not floreat. i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse. i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt. the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through. i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top. please change brand name.,1
This sweater sold out fast at my local retailer store. you know that stuffed animal that you owned when you were a kid  and you would never let it go because it was so soft and snuggly? yeah  it is like that for me. it's a bit pilly but that's what sweaters do. size petite s fit me perfectly (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips)  hem falls 4 inches above my knees  sleeves fall right at my wrist  and it gives room for wearing a sweater or turtleneck under it. hood lays flat  horse print is so cute.,2
"I'm 5'6""  125 lbs  wear size 2 or 4 normally  and small or extra small. 34b bra. i tried on size 2 and it fit great. this dress rocks! i live the soft material and side pockets. not a lover of a line skirts  but this one is subtle. i do need a strapless bra  but if you are more endowed than me  you won't need it. the hem is unseamed  leaving it a bit edgy. since the denium is light i can wear ghis dress now and into summer. i live in texas so probabley won't be wearing it after june. covering my",2
These pants are 100% true to size (whatever that means anymore...i'm a 26 in paige and ag.  i'm 5''6  weigh around 115  have long legs and i ordered the 0p.  the zero petite are still a little long  with a slight heel they're perfect.  they don't have stretch in them  but do to the fit and fabric...the material does expand  because they're thin and breezy.  i absolutely love them.  can't wait to order other colors of the same style.  these are my new favorite pants.,2
I like that the top is lightweight and very comfortable and is flattering. i can see wearing this over the holidays for entertaining. it looks festive and pretty - something easy to pop on and look pulled together in a flash.,2
I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however  when i tried it on  i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality  but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also  the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos  and the floral print isn't as r,1
As cute in person as the picture shows. good quality  worth the money!,2
I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online  so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers  the fit is odd  huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body  being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug,1
I love this dress. it is so flattering and comfortable! i am petite with curves  and feel so good when wearing this. i ordered a petite small. i will have to stop myself from wearing it every day this summer.,2
"This was long on me (i'm 5'1"") but it could easily be cinched up using the drawstring waist. very soft material  this will be a super comfy dress in hot weather. didn't seem too see-through.",2
I love the cardigan. it's super comfy and long enough to cover my behind. the pink and white stripe lining adds a softer touch. it's a little tight in the arms. i'm right between a small and medium  i wish i would have ordered the medium.,2
As the other reviewer said  the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price,0
The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,0
When i received this dress in the mail  i was thrilled. i loved the color and the style  although a bit too much material but comfortable. when i went to show my husband the dress  his first comment was very sexy. i can see your underwear and your skin!!! i don't understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress. when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it.,2
This is a true tiny top........gorgeous and runs small. i usually wear a small or medium in retailer tops  but timy i always size up. i'm a 36c  and a large fits perfect. the front is a bit sheer  but not so much you need a cami.,2
Great piece just wish it fit a bit more blousy rather than cami,2
I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.,2
Beautiful dusty rose color! the fit is fabulous! love the sleeve and hem length! very flattering and does not cling.,2
I just got this in the mail today. it's really cute when i put it on  but it's definitely meant to be worn slightly off the shoulders like the model is showing. i was hoping i could wear it both ways  but then the v-neck becomes way too low. i would recommend sizing down unless you're bigger busted. however  the torso is cut very true to size which might make it hard for some to size down without it becoming too small. a larger bust might help to keep this from falling off the shoulders. i'm not,1
Very nice material  soft and feminine colors. however  the waist sat higher than my natural waist and was uncomfortable. unfortunately it's going back,1
I love this shirt! it's such a beautiful striking color  yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight. the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute. i bought another one of these when it went on sale. so now i have two just in case;) haha,2
Great fitting and super cute!!!!! my husband said this is the cutest bathing suit i've owned!!! and i live in bathing suits!!!,2
Nicer twist on the casual tshirt. soft  comfy. love the purple.,2
This top is comfortable and yet with some stylish detail. the fabric is soft and the lilac color looks great. it hangs loose but with a nice drape. at the sale price it is not to be missed.,2
Loved this dress online  but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie.,0
I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you're well endowed. it's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs. haven't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized (but cozy) and it's really long. it almost touches the top of my knees in back. sooooo pretty though.,2
I love this top  the detail and embroidery make it great for during the day or at night. the small fits me perfect and i don't wear it with a camisole like some have mentioned  but might if i wore it to work,2
These are beautiful pants! the wine color is rich and they are very soft. they just run really small. i normally wear a 25 regular but often i have to roll the length up a bit. so  this time i ordered a 25p thinking it would be the same just shorter -- but i could hardly even pull them over my slinder size 6 foot. i am going to exchange them for a 26 regular. i so hope that they fit -- they are so lovely!! i totally recommend -- just order a size  or maybe two  up. though  to be fair  maybe peti,2
This dress is beautiful and timeless. i wore it to a wedding and received so many compliments. i love how i can also wear it to so many other engagements. i plan to wear it for mother's day brunch  a friend's wedding shower  and know that the clasic cut will be a staple in my closet for years to come. the quality is what you expect for the price and is well worth your investment.,2
This is a great lounging dress or a great beach cover up. i ordered up a size after reading other reviews. although  i feel like my normal size would have been fine probably. i ordered the black and it is not see through. it's very light weight and comfortable. i may even order in another color just because it's so great to wear around the house.,2
I liked this as soon as i saw it. the cross stitch embroidery on the front adds a lot to the usual striped top. the fir is good  not too right or lose. i took a size medium  which was good for my 5' 140 lb frame. the 100% cotton was a plus for me  also. the thing i like the post about retailer is the uniqueness of the clothing. i don't feel like i see myself all over town.,2
This would be perfect if only it were lined!!!! i have a high waist and hourglass shape so jumpers are very hard to find that fit my body type. this is a perfect fit for my body shape and when on  it looks like a lovely dress. however  it is not lined and the material is very light and ivory so you see everything. you can't wear a slip so that leaves the option of some sort of bodysuit if you don't want to show the world what you have. i am very tired of all of the light colored clothing not bei,2
Fit great and cute. cannot wait for summer to wear with sandals.,2
My normal size 32 fit tts. the length is great (i'm 5'9). i love the button detail on the bottom  makes them a little unique.,2
"Great fabric but unfortunately it did not look good on me. maybe on a tall person  i'm only 5'4"". really wanted to like this...",0
The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it's hard to believe this is anna sui. i would say this is unwearable. there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best. going back asap.,0
This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.,0
This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however  the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful  there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference  i am 24 waist,1
"This sweater is much more brilliant in person. the photo online doesn't do it justice. a couple of things  the faux fur collar is removable and it is attached with buttons of the same color as the sweater. the color is also more buttery than it appears. it hits right at the hip  which is so nice for wearing with dresses or skinny jeans and boots for a night out. i am 5'3""  108 pounds and the xs hit me at hipline and was roomy without being oversized. it's really fun and festive with the collar ",2
While the fabric  embroidery and sizing are dead on  i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so  it must go back to retailer.,1
"Had the same inconsistent sizing issue in coral as miss janeausten. i ordered 2 corals  one in s & one in xs & the s was very much smaller than the xs as i could barely get my arms into the s (while my arms were loose in the xs). keeping the ""larger than s"" xs coral - the color is just lovely. also ordered the ivory in both ps & pm & keeping the pm as i like the longer arm length to cover my hands (for sun protection when i want/need). because you can cinch the waist tightly  a looser jacket sti",1
This is a beautiful top  however  my top did not match the one in the picture  it's so odd  the stripes are completely different  it's ok  because it's very pretty  but i do like the one pictured better. it's too short on me for leggings and boots  but it's great with skinny jeans. very pretty and soft material.,2
"Since several reviews said that this dress ran small online  i decided to go to my local retailer store to try this on in person. i am 5""6""  120 lbs. and normally a 0 or 2. the 2 worked perfectly. i loved the red version online but thought the green was better for me in person (the red is a tomato red and was more overpowering on my fair skin). the green also has light blue in the detail print so maybe good if you have blue eyes. no problems with the zippers on the ones i tried at the store.",2
Love this sweater. the hi-low length is fun. the elbow length sleeves are great. wish retailer offered more colors! low part of the sweater is a touch clingy at first but stretches well. works well with jeans or leggings. overall perfect layering piece for all seasons.,2
Absolutely lovely dress  in a gorgeous color  drapes well. the perfect blend of pretty and sexy. so much more beautiful in person!,2
This is an attractive  fitted vest. the tight belt on the back gives it a new look  great shape. the fabric is good quality. the neck is tight and high. i usually get a small at retailer  but this small is way too tight and there is no way you could put a sweater under which you usually do in weather cool enough for a vest. judging from the photo  i would guess she is an extra small wearing a small or medium. it looks good with taupe or brown pants/jeans,2
I have bought other leggings at retailer and they were fine. these run small. i have to return.,2
Very flattering and looks much better on than on the mannequin in store. i an in between small/medium and went with medium which was looser in back and did not show any lumps or bumps. great with jeans  pencil skirts and capris .,2
"I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m  depending on the style  5'3"" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason  on me  the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model  the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but  due to the color and p",2
This was another unusual choice for a larger busted woman like myself  but i couldn't say no to that sweet little back detail. i'll attack the waist with a cropped jacket. for those looking to add volume or flowy fabric  you've found your answer and then some!,1
This robe is warm  soft and i like how long it is! it's perfect length. my favorite thing to wear around the house!,2
These are extremely soft but do run about one size too big with one exception; the opening to pull your feet through that bag nicely around your ankles is soooooo small that you have to work to pull the heel of your foot out. for me  these are dual duty pants; casual wear like to the grocery store or coffee shop trip and second as great soft pj bottoms. though the ankles are small  they do not feel tight at all because the fabric is really that soft. they work well with both my sneakers and clas,2
"I love this sweater! it is true to size and not itchy at all. i am 5'5"" and i bought the small. other reviews said it wasn't as long as it looks pictures but it is the same length on me as it shows on the model. you can wear this with so many things! i can't wait for fall so i can wear it.",2
Great sweater  perfect weight for the office in the summer. love the delicate knit front and triple tie in the back. it was bigger and baggies than i was expecting  but it still works.,2
A sweet tunic with the distinctive lace hemline. the length is great - just right to wear with skinny jeans or over leggings. not too long but long enough for comfort over leggings! more of a boxy fit (just as expected). wore it with my skinny jeans and short boots and got many compliments.,2
The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright  but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.,1
These pants are so great. i am 5'10 and the talls are actually a hair too long. but no complaints! just wish they made every color available in tall. i had been waiting for new colors to get a second pair and was disappointed they are only offered in regular length. but overall these pants are super comfortable and great for work. as far as sizing goes  i wear a 29 in the pilcro cord leggings and wear a 12 in these.,2
"This coat won't take me through a cold boston winter  but i will be willing to sacrifice a little warmth in order to take this beauty out for a night on the town. it's chic  slim  elongating and bold. it looks fantastic paired with some bold tall boots and solid colors underneath. as for sizing  i tend to disagree with most ""runs small"" reviews  but this baby runs small. especially if you really do live in a cold climate and intend to wear something substantial underneath. my bust measurement is",2
Boxy  unflattering  and large.  i'm 5'2'' and a curvy 135 pounds. this top (size s) swallowed me  had no shape  and the material didn't feel great either. i wouldn't even purchase it on sale--there are other graphic tees that are much nicer. i'll be sticking to splendid and sundry.,0
Beautiful - ordered a s  i wear a 2 in most retailer items. hand washed in cold water  shrunk inches  yes inches! love maeve clothing  this shirt is gorgeous. before hand washing in the sink  it was large and flowy. now it barely fits.,0
I was disappointed that this dress had no pockets  as every picture on this website suggests. otherwise  it is a great color and shape. still sad though...,1
"I fell in love with this dress as soon as i came across it online. ordered the dress in a large and it fit perfectly. i'm smaller on top and larger at the bottom (pear shaped). the dress fit well and hid all of my ""flaws"". only problem was that it wrinkled very easily and im wondering if i received a dress that was sitting around for awhile since it was covered with lint and white fuzz when i received it in the mail. other than that the design was absolutely beautiful with incredible embroidery.",2
I love this shirt's color which is a lovely yellow. the fit is nice and flowing. i usually wear xs but intentionally bought s  so that it would be a little lose and i may wear with leggings. my one issue is how transparent it is. i opt to wear a spaghetti strap underneath it  however some women might be ok wearing it alone.,2
A classy t-shirt - can go from work to casual.  the gray and mauve were both drab in color and hard to pair with neutral dress pants.  i chose the white. it definitely runs large  so size down (i.e. wear m/l  chose s).  the fabric is linen  very itch  so tank is probably needed underneath.  flattering fit for curvy figure.,2
I tried this on in the store. i'm usually a 6 in tops but it was tight across the chest. i sized up to an 8 and it was still tight. i would have considered the 10 but with the 8 there was too much fabric on the bottom. overall design and material were good but the sizing was off.,1
In retailer dresses the petites usually fit me better  i'm short  but this regular fit well. looks super cute  i've gotten so many compliments on it. comfortable  and the pockets are always nice.,2
After missing out on last year's similar dress  i am so glad i finally purchased this one! it is beautiful in person. i bought to wear to a wedding  but i am curious if others think it might be too white? i bought the peach color. i will keep this dress no matter what. hope they come out with more next season!,2
"This jacket fits great! i got a medium  and am 5'6""   140 lbs. very nice light weight jacket.",2
I bought this dress for the kentucky derby. i was worried about wearing navy to an event known for bright colors  but the gorgeous lace and rosettes are light and beautiful. i paired it with a lavender hat  and i was ready for a mint julep! i usually wear a 2 or a 4  so i ordered both. the 2 fit best. i will be wearing this dress to a wedding in the fall and for many events for years to come. stunning!,2
Slouchy  longer in the sleeves  a little cropped  great neckline  stylish.....these are just some of the reasons i absolutely love this sweater! i've been looking for a style like this for a long time. i went down a size because of the wide neckline and the fact that it is a bit oversized. i'm petite  119 lbs.  with a 32f bust size. i went with the grey  but i'm loving it so much i might pick one up in the pink. so comfy and cozy and chic!!,2
"Nice work top! i ordered the slightly yellow ivory print  which is beautiful  and the print placement perfect. even better  it's work appropriate. the cotton/synthetic blend has stretch without stretching out.  size: i ordered my normal size small for retailer brands like meadow rue. i'm 5'4""  approx 140 lbs  35-30-37  34d  narrow shoulders  short arms  long torso.  fit: the sleeves are slightly long  but the buttoned cuffs rest at my wrist. the fabric blend allows this top very good drape. i like",2
I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh,1
I love the fit  feel and quality but i didn't realize these are the new improved fabric denim weave that has almost no stretch.  i usually wear a 28 and i wish i had purchased the 29 or 30 to accommodate my weight fluctuations.  the great thing about this style is that i will not stretch out at the stress points unattractively.,2
This product fit perfectly. the color is as pictured or slightly bigger. perfect for a day or night out,2
Searching for blazers that don't look stuffy? this one fits the bill! mine is at alterations right now getting the sleeves shortened. other than the long sleeves the fit is very nice. this will be a versatile addition to my wardrobe. can't wait to get it back from the seamstress so i can wear it!,2
Pretty much awesome... i tried it on in regualr size jsut to see  and i could almost get away with it... too bad i dind't try it on before hte 25% of f dresses... (also  i don't have an occasion to wear this).  length is midi  but since it is gathered  i could pull it up a little so it falls in the right spot on me.  color is very nice  overall sexy dress.  material is soft and comfortable  nothing wrong except i missed out on the sale! :-),2
Well  i totally disagree with the previous reviewer on this one! i think this top is very pretty. yes  it does hide any flaws in the tummy  but it is not wide nor does it make you look pregnant (side or front view). i am 5 ft  2 inches  broad shouldered  36c and the small fit nicely (i usually wear a small to medium in retailer tops). i am thinking of purchasing the xs as there is still plenty of room around the chest/arm area. the lace is pretty  looks good worn with a dark colored pant. the only,2
I love  love  love this sweater.  it is slightly fitted so that is drapes beautifully.  notice it has 3/4 length sleeves which is fine for north caroline where it does not really get cold.  i purchased the blue and i wore it with fitted jeans.,2
I loved the fabric and this print but it was just cut a little wrong for me. the gathering on the side made me look a bit wide. but the fabric is beautiful and everything else was nice. i did like the fact that it ties in the back so you can slim down the sillouhette (sp?) if you want to.,2
This skirt looks and feels cheap  and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally  i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds  and this is still way too tight to be flattering.,0
"I love this dress and had so hoped to wear it to a wedding in june. the fabric is a perfect weight  very nice cotton  i only wish i could have kept it. i am 5'3""  133 lbs and usually wear a size 6 which is what i ordered. it was fine in the skirt but the top was at least a size if not two sizes too small for 32 chest. i did not want to wear it open with a tee and so had to send it back. the wedding date does not allow for the new available date for the dress.",1
This top is really pretty and flattering. i bought my usual size and its loose and flows without being too boxy. the pattern is beautiful and the band on the top stays up well.,2
This cardigan is utterly gorgeous. way prettier on than i feared. my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms  and so i finally looked closely at the tag. the tag says the *back* section (which looks exactly like the weave on the arms) has a measly 5% wool snuck into the fabric content. why  retailer? why wool? i am so sensitive to it! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day  classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it.  now i have a problem,1
"I'm 5'5"" 127lbs. ordered size small. not sheer. bodysuit snaps. great to wear with skirts and wide leg pants!!",2
Dress is true to size. has a built in liner with thin straps so it is not see through. really cute on.,2
I received this top and loved the pattern. however  i ordered both and s and m  and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c  and the bust area was way too big on both  but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it's just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau  so that added to the odd look of the bust. it's still a beautiful pattern  so if you're going to give it a try orde,1
"This a lovely piece. you have to see it close up to appreciate the subtle details. i typically wear xxsp or xsp  so i did not expect this to fit  but decided to try it because i liked the style. as a petite  many poncho styles overwhelm me and look like tents. not this one. the xxs fit nicely - just the right length and width. i am 5'1"" and 108 lbs. i think one of the reasons this has not been popular is because it only shows up when searching on ponchos  and not when you search for sweaters. it",2
I normally wear a large or extra-large; the medium is still very billowy on me. this blouse is ethereal and lovely  though - pretty and funky at the same time. it's sheer but somehow not revealing. perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer.,2
I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight  totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you've owned them for years  they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on.   ----------  i am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans  and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well. i do not have an hourglass figure (my shou,0
I love it! it's cute and short and shows off my legs. the material is thick and great quality  so great for the fall. the color is great for florida!!! brightness year round. it's fits perfectly. i purchased a 14 and it fits like a glove. i am going to wear with my booties and a jacket like the model. hey it works!!!,2
My husband bought me these joggers for a retreat i went on. they are so comfortable and really cute. i am usually a size 4 and the size small fit great with some room.,2
It is a beautiful top but runs huge!!! i followed other reviews and ordered a size down hoping it would work but it was totally unflattering! i wanted so bad to love it but there was no way i could keep it!!,0
I love the details of this top  from the pleating to the sleeves  the pommed edges and the black lace at the bottom. the material is soft and comfortable. the fit is flowy and the details are feminine yet simple. it's light weight which will be nice in warm weather. and let me say once more how much i love the sleeves.,2
I got the blue print and i love it. easy to match with any bottom really. i like that it can be made strapless.,2
"This dress is horrible. i can't believe they can get away with calling it a ""dress"". it should have been called a tunic or shirt. it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures  no way. it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff. it came to the top of my thighs. i can't find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it. the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth.",0
I want to be the person who lounges like the model...but this was huge and more wool-feeling than the lightweight shawl i was hoping for. i am an 8  got the xs/s it was the right size....i returned it.,1
"This dress is so comfortable and versatile. you can dress it up or down and it's perfect for almost any summer occasion. i have it in the black color and it goes with almost everything! the only complaint i have is the arm holes drop a little too low. you can see part of my bra because of this but it's not too drastic. i'm 5'4"" with an athletic build and i feel like the petite would have fit me better. regardless  it's a great dress.",2
My favorite shirt!!! i wear it when i don't want to be in the sun too long  it has breathable material in the armpit. i loved so much ordered in other colors. i wish they would make in more colors!,2
"This dress is made well; the construction/sewing details give the dress a beautiful shape. it has a nice zipper at the back  and fabric feels light. pockets are a good size. skirt flows  but doesn't feel heavy. fit is comfortable. i typically wear somewhere between a size 4/6. i ordered a 4 and it fits just right. i'm 5""6 and it falls below my knee--length is nice. armholes are a bit lower than i thought  but not too low. it's a classic/modern look. it was sold out when i first wanted to buy it ",2
Great tee for layering  love the sweet lace along the bottom. the lace lines the entire body of the tee and it's a little thin so i prefer a cami underneath but a nude bra would be invisible. i usually wear a small  sometimes an xs  and the small fits like it does on the model.,2
As a dancer and yoga enthusiast i have tried my fair share of leggings. these are probably the best i've ever found. pure + good makes top quality  well fitting leggings that do not slide down  shift around  or become see-through regardless of the physicality of your movement. they breathe wonderfully and have survived one washing with no ill-effects. they are high enough in the rise that i never have to worry about revealing anything i don't want  nor do i constantly have to adjust them to keep,2
"I didn't end up keeping this dress...it just wasn't right for me. it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin (partially lined which is a plus) and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me. i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slit/vent was just too high for my liking. the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 5'4"" (~118#). i guess i just didn't ""love"" it and would rather save my funds for something i ca",2
I saw this shirt and it was love at first sight. i have never had so many strangers randomly compliment me until i wore this beautiful top. fits great  looks even better.,2
This is a heavy dress - it's surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress. and on my frame  which is pretty thin  it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls... so the heft of it means there's no waistline... it's an odd fit. the color is gorgeous  but the lack of shape made this a no.,1
"I love this jumpsuit. i've worn it twice and received many compliments both times. absolutely gorgeous. i couldn't be happier. 5'5""  135  34c-6.",2
So many things to love about this top. if you're a fan of peplum tops - which i most definitely am - this is a great one. slightly shorter in front than in back. nice flare  but doesn't stick out too far. and overall  i thought it was well-made. i tried on the red in stores  and it looks a lot like the color in the photo. however  i'm a 36dd  and unfortunately  the top was just not large enough. totally squashed the girls  and there's basically no give in the fabric. i'm normally a 10/12  and ot,2
This was exactly what i was looking for: a spring dress i could wear while it was still cool out. loved the colors  pattern  and the fact that it could hide a belly bulge. but i got it in a petite small  and i was swimming in it. i got it in an xs  and the body of it was just right  but the bust was so tight i nearly ripped it trying to climb out (and i'm a barely an a cup). i don't normally have this problem with dresses  but in this case the top and bottom half of the dress felt like they were,1
This top has so many details. i love the material. it adds a little formal to the casual jean. i am waiting to wear this come fall weather with slim jeans and some boots. it gives me that old victorian vibe without being still and formal.,2
Dress is much different in person. thin ribbed cotton.  a little tight for xl.    it looks like a throw back dress from contempos.  returned and would not recommend,1
Love these pants. the design is totally different and that is what i love! i paired these with the velvet red shoes from this site - also on sale. for me these ran true to size.,2
This sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall. wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters. love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho. true to size  great color. lot's of compliments.,2
I loved everything about this dress. the fit  the style and the ability to wear in the fall. i wore it once  washed it in gentle/hand-wash cycle  in cold water and laid it out flat to dry- per the instructions- and it shrank at least a full size. it's going back. i am so sad  as i said earlier  i really loved this dress.,0
I just got a pair of these in petite 28. and really like them. i am short though so even the petite length is too long for me- i wish it was the height of the cuff shorter than it is so i end up folding the cuff up. it still looks cute though. the stitching details are nice and quality seems good. hoping they hold up. the fabric seems durable if not a little too thick for hot summer weather but great for indoor a/c office temperatures. i am not going to buy another pair at full price but would c,2
I really like this jacket! it runs big  so you may want to size down. the fabric was softer than i was expecting  but i really like it. very cute fall jacket!,2
This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes,0
Well  this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event  but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either  although the lace is nice.,1
I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i can't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.,2
These cords are seriously fantastic. worth the price indeed. they are very comfy  have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape! the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop. they do run big  i got a 26 and i'm usually a 27. they are also very long! nothing a little trip to tailors can't fix. overall  highly recommended.,2
"This dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites! (i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering...so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well!) i ordered in the 2p. i am 5'4"" about 120#. it fits beautifully...even though it's a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p (it is no longer available though). but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is",2
Ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats- the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight. the coat has an odd shape - not a line or straight. the medium was large on me. the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges. sadly this coat will be returned.,0
I bought this today in black. it fits true to size and is very flattering. i love the draping  the weight of the fabric  and the length . i would buy it in another color i like it so much. i will probably wear this with jeans and boots with a sweater over it. i wasn't sure i was going to like the little connector piece across the front neckline  but it works. if it wasn't there the top would probably gape open.,2
Lovely top  well made and feels wonderful on. attention petites - i highly suggest you go for petite sizing because the standard xs is ginormous and looked nothing like it does on the model pictured.,2
Very lovely sweater - lightweight with cute detailing at the side of the waist  sweet but not saccharine bow at the back of the neck. i really wanted to love this sweater  but it had to go back because it looked  um  used. pilling along the arms before i even got to wear it? it got returned  sadly.,1
"I'm really glad i read the previous reviews on this. i'm normally between a 27 or 28. thought a 28 would work best for me seeing that it's high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys  the 27 fits very comfortably.     i""m 5'7 and i can wear them with flats.",2
This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,0
This can be worn now on its own or as the weather gets colder it will make a great layering piece  i bought one and liked it so much i bought it in another color,2
I ordered this dress in oatmeal the minute i saw it online. i'm 5'5 and 115 lbs. and my usual xs fits perfectly. i would say this dress will be the most flattering on a long lean body type. (it will show bumps and bulges.). i will wear it asap with booties and a jacket. and it also looks great with flip flops or sandals for the summer. very happy!,2
I rarely write reviews  but this one deserves one. this top is completely  utterly  adorable! it flows so beautifully  which makes it perfect to wear with leggings/skinny jeans. i wore mine with a blazer for a work holiday party  and i received so many compliments. this top makes you feel so feminine and pretty. i love the maeve brand  and this is certainly no exception! i'd love to get it in multiple colors!,2
Fits true to size and has a great shape. i get compliments each time i wear it  glad i purchased it.,2
I just bought this adorable top in the black motif and was surprised by how good it looked! it runs tts (34d-27-35) and got it in my usual size small. it's very soft  the print is so cute  the arm openings aren't too big and the length is just like on the model  not too long or short. i think it's even cuter in person and i like the price point. a very sweet top so worth a try!,2
I probably would have never purchased this blouse is i had only seen it online. but i was at our local store looking for something else and spotted it hanging all the way on the other end of the store. a salesperson encouraged me to try it on and it is beautiful! it can easily be dressed up or down. you can tie the bow in multiple ways or leave it hanging. it is sheer but the pattern obscures the transparency so no camisole is needed. it embraces the 70's vibe in a modern way. i absolutely love,2
I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately  it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger  but just not on me.,1
"Tried and pictured the regular size small. my stats are 34/35a-28-36 and i usually wear a 6 or an 8 on top in shirts and blazers. the small here was nicely loose so it might run a bit big.  in person  the colors are dark navy on light beige.  lovely heavy weight cotton and stitching.  i think it's deliberately a bit short  hit at my hip (i'm 5'6"") but i like this.  the 3/4"" sleeves are a bit nowhere for me...i wish they were full length but that's my only quibble.",2
I first ordered this in the patterned denim. the online photo looks washed out in comparison. the blouse has very pretty detail all along the body and cute brass buttons. the pattern unfortunately looks more vivid in person and as result  i did not like. i brought it to the store and tried on white but it was very sheer (all though the pleating in front helps). i ended up exchanging it with plum which is also beautiful - not as much sheen as shown on the photo  but still beautiful.,2
I'm always on the hunt for good white blouses to pair with business casual attire or everyday wear. this was a great tank. i love the fabric. it's nice and sturdy and you don't have to worry about wearing a cami beneath it. this fabric does wrinkle some so bear that in mind. i really like the shape of the top near the shoulders. it's a great conservative cut. the little criss cross detail on the back adds a bit of charm to the top. i would definitely recommend this to others.,2
I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said  i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length  down for arm length ...,0
Wasn't too sure about this jacket when i got it in the mail - seemed a little boxy on - maybe a smaller size would've worked better but i want to be able to layer. however  i'm keeping it because it's versatile  i love the contrast of the front/back and the buttons on the sleeve (which actually button and un-button  meaning they aren't just for show and the sleeves can be easily rolled up). a great basic jacket with some neat details.,2
"I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat  the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium  worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning  so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her.",1
It's a cute top  but the only complaint i have is that it is difficult for me take off. it goes on easily  but i get always have a bit of a struggle trying to take it off. my shoulders tend to get stuck so i can't pull my arms out easily. i just wish the top had an extra button or two on the back or was made with material that allowed for some stretch without fear of destroying the lacework. i didn't want to size up another size because i have a petite body shape that would've been overwhelmed b,2
Great skirt! i bought the red and paired it with a casual white button down. i feel like the top definitely needs to be short or tucked in for the look to work. i am typically a 2 in bottoms  and went with the small in this. the xs probably fits more like it's intended to  but it is very curve-hugging  and i was more comfortable with the looser fit of the small (especially since i am tucking in a blouse). there is stretch in the skirt  and the fabric has a nice feel.,2
Absolutely gorgeous.  i never have been a yellow person but today i am converted.  all the colors are vibrant and true to the photo. i'm 5'6 and the length is perfect for flat sandals and my wedges  so i can dress it up or be stunningly casual.  i range from 14-16/ l-xl in retailer dresses.  the size is dictated by my broad shoulders. since this one is sleeveless i went with the large and it's perfect.  the nude slip has clasps to keep the straps in place and its adjustable. the slip is als,2
When i received this dress i was surprised by the weight of the fabric. it's not as light and gauzy as the photos appear  and it is fully lined. it's more substantial in a good way. also i had thought it would be more of a straight cut but it's definitely a swing which i prefer. with the lining  it does stand out a bit from your body so it's not a clingy look at all. i like it a lot but i don't think it fits the way you would expect from the photo. it's roomy  i could probably have sized down. i,2
So many compliments and so comfortable--all i want from a pair of pants. i am 5'8+ and around 135 and a little bit of a pear  and these fit perfectly in size 28l. they felt a little tight at first and then stretched to be ideal. i bought black and really love the softness  the rise  and the way they go with everything. thinking of going back for one in the dark red. this will be a winter staple to dress up or down.   i just hope they don't wear out too quickly!,2
Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it),2
"I'm very pleased with this jacket! i've never owned a ""vegan"" leather anything  so i didn't know if it would show up cheap looking or smelly.. but to my surprise  it didn't have a ""smell"" or that shiny cheap look. i'm so glad i headed the other reviewers advise and i sized up  my typical size would have been to tight and short! i'm excited to wear this with dresses and jeans this fall! i bought the ""honey"" color and it's more like a cross between beige and blush(a slight dusty pink hue)! i love",2
I got the red  which was short sleeved. the shirt itself was so cute  but the fit is very boxy. i got a small and it was way too wide. far wider and shorter in the waist than the picture shows. i am sad to return  but it makes me look like a square. (shape that is),0
"I recently purchased the reading room cardigan in the color pink. the color is beautiful  and very flattering with my olive complexion. i ordered a medium  and although it's not a traditional fitted cardigan  the shape was very flattering  good length for my 5' 6"" height  and is very versatile. great for transitional weather into spring.",2
This dress is exactly what i hoped it would be! super sexy and great material.,2
Love this shirt it has a femine look with a casual style.,2
I love this shirt! it is classic and elegant. it is versatile and can go with lots of different things. be mindful  it is see-through so you must wear a tank underneath. i got it in white and it can be dressed up or down. i like how the sleeves are slightly longer than your average shirt. definitely recommend.,2
I love the dress!  i purchased this dress to wear on my honeymoon to paris.  it made me feel like a princess walking around the gardens of versalles while wearing it!,2
I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so  it's too big but the length works)  or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable  and the design is different in a good way.,2
I love the feel of the fabric and design of this dress.  i look forward to changing the look with cowboy boots or fringed booties. i also like the option of wearing it opened over a white tee and jeans. worn loose or belted  it can be different every time you wear it. it does run large so you may want to size down.,2
This piece is gorgeous in person. it is more of a broen than taupe and goes with everything... it is more of a coat than a sweater. i bought one for my mom  and picked one up for myself when it went on sale. it is moms favorite piece among her extensive retailer collection.,2
"This dress has a much more flattering fit than appears! it has curves and fits tts. the fabric is fairly heavy  nice quality polyester and will be just the right weight for a nocal wedding. the back straps nicely cover foundations so even though it's open you don't need special undergarments. the color in the pic is spot on. don't be deceived by the ""turquoise"" moniker.",2
I wanted to love this dress but it was too large... and once i washed it (which is recommended) it shrank so i had to return it.,1
I am usually a size small and had to size down to an xsmall. as mentioned in another review  it runs large in the armholes and across the bust  which is why i'm counting off one star. the armholes are also cut in quite a bit  so i will wear either a strapless or racerback bra. i am fairly small busted and the gathers falling from the yoke lay nicely; however  i can see that it might not work for someone who is more amply endowed and that it might have a maternity look. that said  the detailing i,2
Great buy. i bought the cream jumpsuit.  i'm small on bottom and larger on top. this was perfect  shouldn't fit tight  should flow  has lots of room  it is linen  adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit. legs are wide and flowy. casual but classy. both sides have about 3 buttons at hips. great addition to any closet. unique in its own right.,2
Awesome basic top for your wardrobe. it's a little sheer but not too much.,2
"This is the third jumpsuit i've ordered and written a review for this season. this jumpsuit is the best by far. i bought it in my usual size small (32d--31-38) and it fit me  even though i'm tall (5' 8.5""). i would say it looks much the same as it does on the model  maybe an inch shorter in the legs on me. love that the legs are rolled up by a tab and a snap--no uncomfortable elasticized legs. i am more legs than long torso (i usually wear a 33"" inseam with flats). the jumpsuit is very easy to g",2
Dare i say  this is my favorite pair of pilcro legging cords yet. the pattern is beautiful  with green  black  and grey. the fit is as usual stellar and comfortable. the best yet!,2
Always love getting pilcro pants and these are just as good as previously purchased ones. i got the grey in 32 and i'm glad i did - i've ranged from a size 30-34 so i wasn't super sure which size would be be best.,2
"The dress fit fine  with two exceptions. first  i am 5'1""  and i ordered a petite 4. the dress was dragging on the ground  so it would need hemming if i were keeping it. but the deal breaker was that the gathering of the outer fabric over the bust stuck out an inch beyond my 34d figure  which made me look like i had very oddly shaped nipples. i made the assumption that the dress i received was defective  so sent it back  but unfortunately  the replacement fit the same way. the lining fabric fit",0
"I thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos. i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange. the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it cannot be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it (i'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment). i was also confused by the front ""collar"" ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open  folded over  partly folded over - it just didn't seem to have a particular style to this area.",1
I loved the style when i saw it online and even more in person. the fabric is light but not too light. it has a nice drape i didn't expect. easy to wear and style. the draw string gives it a great shape but a belt is a great addition for more interest. the length is fantastic as well. wonderful midi length but with the side slits.,2
I bought this shirt in the black cat print. the material is very soft and it has a nice drape. i wear a size 32dd and worried that the size zero may be too small across the bust but it fits perfectly. i am 5 feet tall with a petite frame. the front of the shirt falls a few inches below my waistline and the back of the shirt is longer and provides plenty of coverage so it can be worn with skinny jeans. i can also wear this to work with a pair of slacks and it looks nice. i would actually love to,2
This shirt is more stunning in person. the color is a brighter turquoise than shown & the details are beautiful. fits true to size & is very flattering/slimming. love it!,2
I bought this in red in xs (5'5 115lbs). it's really cute and flirty  but not in a little girl way  which some ruffle tops can look. the material is nice. a little over priced  but isn't everything from retailer?! the red is a perfect red imo  it's got an orange-y undertone to it  looks so good with white jeans and black sandals. if you're inbetween sizes  i would size down but otherwise pretty true to size. i wear everything in xs from retailer and the xs fits perfect.,2
I seriously love this skirt! i bought it for my college graduation and i was complimented by everyone that saw it. not only that  but it is beyond versatile  you can dress it up  make it casual  or make it professional. it is extremely ideal especially for the price. it also is the most comfortable skirt i've ever worn  so that's a plus.,2
"Love this dress and its versatility! great design concept. fabric is pretty soft  cozy  and warm  as well. i found the dress to run large. i ordered a medium in the gray and small in the rose. i did like both colors irl  but the size small was the best fit. for reference  i'm 5'6""  135 lbs  and wear a 6. the size small hit just above my knees and the sleeves reached down to my knuckles. i wore this around the house for awhile and realized that while the knit was nice and tight when i first put i",2
The fabric pattern is darling. i wore it in amsterdam and was told it looks like a traditional folk pattern. the dress is lightweight and is loose at the waist. sometimes i add a belt to cinch it in.  like another reviewer said  the buttons do pop off easily. i lost one at the cuff on the first day i wore the dress.,2
I thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build. instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected. i felt dowdy in it.,1
This is a cute dress  but it runs very large through. if i had decided to keep it  i would have taken it to my seamstress to remove some of the volume. when i ordered  i assumed it was red and black checked  but it is navy. my black cropped leather jacket and boots won't work with those colors  so it is going back.,1
Bought these today at the denver store (nice peeps at cc!). anyway  i feel in love. the style is simple  free and easy for summer and the neutral color is lovely in person. so glad i bought these...now i have something to wear to work tomorrow :)!,2
Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.,1
The design of this top is super cute and the material is decent. the only flaw is that despite buying the smallest size (xxsp)  it's still very boxy on me. i wish it was more fitted at the waist which would make it much more flattering. however  since i am actually pregnant  this actually works to my advantage  for the time being.,2
I tried this one without a bra  and t was fine... a little droopy but i could go without.  the things that bothered me: the pattern wasn't even on both sides  so where the seem is on the legs by the wait  didn't match... some people may not be annoyed by that  but hard for me not to look at.  also  the length on the model is just below the knee. i usually order petite  but tried on regular size in the store... i liked it like that  the hem went to below the big part of my calf  so it 3was flatte,2
Love the fabric  so soft and comfortable. it gives a very flattering silhouette. love those pants.,2
Slightly disappointing. i wanted the picture -- the full-on flare. it has very little flare. that said  they're still comfortable jeans  so i'll keep them.,1
"The first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric didn't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue.  i'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage  which was a nice surprise  because i usually avoid anything with fullness.  will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect.  i'm short  5'3"".  neckline is fem",2
This top is great! it looks much better in person. it's still kind of a faded look but it's not as light as shown here. also  the exact location of the plaid is different on each top. it runs just a tiny bit large but i liked it loose so took my normal size. there is another fabric lining the front in a very cute print. will be a nice  loose and cool top for summer. love the tie in the back as well.,2
Dress really pretty and great quality. slip is small if large breasted.,2
I love the way this dress looks on me. it skims my figure to hide my flaws  the bright embroidery is eye catching  the layers flow when i walk  it's a great midi length and it doesn't make me look wider in profile.  i'm not having the see-through issue since the patterns are busy and my lingerie matches.  i purchased 10 petite and my measurements are 39-28-35.       my dilemma is three fold: the material is polyester & rayon  causing some uncomfortable heat to generate when sitting. then there's,2
Beautiful dress! vibrant colors. fabric has a nice weight and drapes perfectly. 36 dd up top and the girls have plenty of space.,2
Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y.,1
Unfortunately  this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8  130lbs  and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also  while the dress is lined  both layers are quite thin- not see through  but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material  it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.,0
Although i haven't worn it yet  it is very soft and functional. i will watch how i wash it so it stays that way.,2
The model looks like she's 14 years old - this sweater of course would fit a younger teen. it definitely won't work for a grown woman. please make some longer sweaters.,1
It does snag easily which stinks because it's darling and i love it to pieces.... i just hope it doesn't end up in pieces!,2
These pants have great style and movement.,2
"I ordered this in the ""plum"" color  which in real life just looks like a very  very dark brown. that would probably be okay  but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length  but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way  way too short. i am 5'5""  for reference. lastly  i think the fabric is just awful quality  especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou",0
I ordered the xxs because it seems like a flowy top  and glad i did  it fits perfectly. love the blue color  very rich. material is super soft  cut is very flattering  and i love the back. i tried it on with my strapless since that is what i was wearing  but not sure if straps show on a regular bra. (30dd for info),2
I love this top! i think the knit rib quality is quite lovely and the color is gorgeous. i bought the plum color and got many compliments while wearing it. i like that it's a little on the longer side. i wore it with my pull-on ponte pants and booties. very cute!!,2
This dress is most definitely not a maxi! barely goes below the knees. also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice. there are no folds which were an added plus on picture. waist is higher  not at natural waist. very pretty silk though and still cute. just not as pictured.,1
Love this top. very flattering on an hour glass figure because even though it has a more of an empire waist it is not so volumous as to overwhelm the figure --as so many retailer tops are these days. one caution: i had to go up a size to accommodate my bust.  normally a size 6 or small in retailer tops but a 34dd  so went up to a size 8.  the top is more snug around the bustline so just be warned if you are well endowed.    the fabric is sheer but not overly so  embroidery is well done. over all a b,2
The top is indeed a bit boxier than i was expecting  as the other reviewer found. it still looks good tucked in if you're concerned about it. the fact that it's sustainably produced in ghana was a big part of my desire to keep it too. really great to see designers producing clothing responsibly! i wish that how a garment is manufactured is highlighted more on this site because it definitely contributes to my purchases.,2
Nice stretchy shirt. nothing special so i wouldn't pay more than sale price.,2
Fell in love with this a soon as i saw it in store. it is soft and can eaisly be dressed up or down. wore it to work already and got so many compliments.   unfortunately when i saw it in store they didn't have it in stock. the very helpful gentlemen at the irvine  ca location checked online but it was sold out in my size. so he checked the stores that carried it. i called one and the mailed it to me. customer service in store is great!,2
Lovely socks  great color  stitched well  a little thin,2
I love this shirt! i wore it to a friend's baby shower and received a lot of compliments on it. the neckline and shoulders and very flattering  but then i'm not very busty  so maybe that's why it worked for me. the material is hand-wash only  but well worth it for such a unique  pretty top. i also didn't get any weird smell from this shirt nor did i think the material was too stiff.,2
Love this top  it's a 100% cotton and looks amazing with jeans. you should consider ordering a size up  i am usually an 0  32d and 107pound. tried the 0 in store it just didn't feel right the size 2 fit just right. love the shirt  and got tons of complement:),2
"I tried on the xs in store  and loved it. stylist said i need xs petite  but otherwise  it looks great. the cut is flattering  the neckline is a tad higher and almost has a mini cowl. the colors are neutral and would love to wear with a nice pair of dark flared pants. or skinnies. so at 115 lbs  30dd  i would go with xs petite( i am below 5'2""). fabric is very soft too...",2
I love this piece! like another reviewer i did notice a broken button right out of the package but it was so great in every other way that i'm going to keep it and have that mended and the buttons reinforced.  i'm 5' 7  140  generally a size 8/medium  small frame on top but baby growing hips ;) -- i found it tts,2
"I have been looking for the perfect jumpsuit and this is it! i am 5'7.5"" and 122 lbs and the small is a perfect fit! the fabric is super comfy  you can wear a regular bra (yay!) and it can be dressed up or down! i am looking forward to taking this on my european vacation in august! the blue is a very pretty blue but i opted for the black!",2
Currently wearing right now :)  purchased during the first days of the tag sale. runs large (i.e. i typically wear m-l  and ended up going with a small!). definitely need a tank underneath  as the hook does not close the top of fully. like the blue color; the pink is more of a peach and made me look incredibly washed out.  a must at the tag sale price!,2
What a cute shirt! i got the red and white and it's definitely a summer shirt although i'm sure you could make it look cute under a cardigan. i'm a 10 m and the m fit well. tts.,2
"I just purchased this blouse in store! the fabric has a nice weight and drape  feels nice to the touch and is opaque. i'll be wearing this one as a dress and a top. i'm 5'2"" and this fell a couple inches above my knee. i typically wear an xs at retailer and opted to go with a small for the extra length and because i hate when off the shoulder silhouettes pop up and become not so off the shoulder. i laid the xs and small out to compare sizing and didn't notice a major  difference width wise. i typi",2
Retailer sleep pants are my favorite...the only sleep pants i will wear. fit is perfect. flowing shape and ultra-soft fabric feel like a little bit of luxury. first thing i put on when i get home from work!,2
"I love this top. it was everything i hoped it would be. it is lined so it is not see through in the chest/back; sleeves are sheer. soft. gorgeous color. love the layers. runs large so definitely size down. i am usually a m and ordered the s. i'm 5'8"" curvy 32dd",2
"I'm 5'7"" with a dd bust and this top in a medium doesn't even hit at my hip. i'm not sure why so many of these tops are being made so short! i just purchased another peasant lace top that has the same problem #it ends up being very boxy looking!#. adding a few inches in length would have made this top perfection! debating about ordering a large just to add length but otherwise the tops fits everywhere else ;# it's so pretty though! the lace detail and the nude panel are so delicate and the mater",1
I bought this dress as a pool/beach coverup but it is so cute i think i will also wear it other times as well. it is very comfortable and lightweight. perfect for the hot weather.,2
"I just received this top in the mail and i couldn't be happier with how it fits and feels on. might have to wear a camisole under with a bit see through in front. it is very true to size and drapes beautifully with the back being very feminine. i am 5'6"" and the length falls just about the same on myself as does the model. i will wear with skinny jeans with the nice length working well with them.",2
"I found this at my retailer store--the only dress left. i bought this in black in my usual size small (4-6). this dress was so pretty on and fabulous in hot weather. the material is gauzy and so the look is casual. i'm not sure i would wear it in the evening but the fit was great. i am tall  (5' 9"") and the dress is long enough for me. i would say it is the same length as on the model. it is a bit pricey for what it is but i bought it as a birthday gift to myself.",2
Simple pull-on pant with a great design. they look flattering on and can easily be dressed up. i wear between a 4 and 6 and the small fit perfect. i have washed them and worn them several times and they still seem good as new. the wide elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place.,2
This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.,0
I'm one of those people who is juuuust right between being regular and petite sized  so i have a hard time with some longer tunic styles. this tee is pretty fitted though the shoulders and bust  which makes the rest of the top kind of skim over the body. i like that  especially for those days where i feel a little bloated or like i want to hide out a bit.     the fabric is very comfortable and not sheer. the little stripe down the back is a cute detail and it's in a slightly contrasting fabric w,2
I love this shirt! red + navy is one of my fave color combos  and the vintage feel is fantastic. the fabric is a little thicker and more sweater-like than i was expecting  but it's a good thing. the top isn't heavy  but the knit gives it more texture & interest. this is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy look...covered  but form-fitting and flattering.,2
Love the print and comfort of this tank  however  it does run about 2 sizes larger than normal. it is also not a fitted tank  it has some flow which is not exactly what i was looking for.,1
Love the detail of this top; however  it runs large and had no shape on me,1
The print and style we're great! unfortunately  my bust unbuttons the top. there's no way i can wear this  even if i sized up.,0
I just bought these jeans today & they are really cute & comfortable on. i love pilcro jeans as they fit really well  they are made well & they are always on style. i did have to go down a size as well but they fit beautifully! comfy & stylish!,2
I'm an xl in all retailer tops  and sometimes the xl are still too small to fit loosely; i don't like to wear tight clothes. having said that  i had to purchase this top in a size small because it was just cut so large. the sleeves hang a bit odd if you don't get the correct size. i love the feel of the blouse  the fabric is a nice quality. i recommend giving it a try but have patience during the process of figuring out the size that will look best on you in this blouse.,2
"I love this faux-fur coat. i wear it both dressed up & down. i usually wear xs but bought s so i could wear sweaters under it and the arms would still be long & i'm happy i did (5'4"" 103 for reference). the faux is soft & comfy. it's warm  but not blizzard warm. i get loads of compliments on it when i wear it & ""where did you get that?""  definitely worth the purchase on sale.",2
I purchased this in london  early april  and i wore it to a summer wedding. it was perfect and hangs very nicely. the colors are rich and the deep blue flowers have texture. the front slit goes up to about the knee but doesn't split apart when walking which i appreciated. the only thing that i felt was a little off was the circumference of the sleeves. i have to keep them unbuttoned but thankfully it looks like just an interesting detail and not so much like an unbuttoned sleeve. a definite keep,2
This dress is truly a no brainer purchase! it is a stunning dress with gorgeous embroidery  beading and  the color is just perfect for fall! i am only 5'2 and i went with the regular size since i don't like to go too short. that said  you can totally rock this dress with leggings and boots if it is too short. i weigh 103 lbs and i am normally an xxs but i'm glad i went with the xs since it would have been too tight at the top and should even  be slightly loose fitting on the bottom. love everyth,2
I'm in love with these jeans! they come very long  but it's easy to cut them down where you want them since they are not hemmed. i have a short torso so for me they were high waisted  but still flattering  which surprised me! for reference  i am 5'2  105#  and i got the size 24.,2
Love love these jeans. they are just the right rise and the straight leg is perfect. the color of the demin is great to wear to work. the fit is great.,2
Just picked this up at my retailer and i just love it. its totally different than your typical tee. the bottom is more of a blousy silk material and the top is a super soft knit. it lays really well and is long enough to wear with leggings! my favorite part is the t strap in the back. such a beautiful detail and so much fun. my only criticism with this top is where it hits on the bust. im a little more full figured  so the top looks better on me when the silk part isn't under my boobs. kinda have,2
Probably should have noticed the material this jumpsuit is made of before buying. tencel  thus little to no give kind of like linen and silk. beautiful material  soft with a slight sheen. the top portion fits well and the triangles cover the girls well (36dd). unfortunately there is no give on the back end for my bottom which is quite round and its tight around my thighs which aren't small either. (l/xl and 14). and sadly an xl would be too big upstairs and baggy around the middle. sigh  oh well,2
"This pair of age stevie capris is everything that i could want in a pair of jeans!! soft  sexy (without being skintight) and the perfect color of blue!! i am 5'3""/108 lbs and the 25 was a perfect fit!! these hit about an inch above my ankle and looked amazing (think legs that look a mile long!!) with booties one night and nude heels the next!",2
Cute and comfy. seems to fit true to size. flattering and roomy on top for my 34ddd shape  but doesn't make me look pregnant or fat overall  which sometimes happens without a waist to define shape. super cute!,2
Thrilled this statement piece is back. i get so many compliments on this and it's practical as well for our cold minnesota winters. highly recommend!,2
If you're looking for a great day to night shirt this is it. perfect transition from the office to happy hour,2
I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock  or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing  as i'm fairly skinny  but still curvy  and while i love my curves  i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this  however  is a godsend.,2
The detail and design is gorgeous on the tank. my issue however is that the yellow is pretty bright. the website makes it look like a butter yellow but it is actually a lemon yellow. i do not care for that shade and would definitely limit what i paired it with. bummer!,1
"This sweater is a pretty color and style and is really soft and comfortable - i really wanted it to work. a small fit my 5'7""  140 lb frame well (32dd) but the ruffles on the hips were not a wanted addition unfortunately. . tried it on three separate times to try to change my mind but in the end  it's going back. i would not suggest it if you have an athletic or hourglass figure with even a little hip.",1
I love this skirt. it fits perfectly. great to transition from work to after-work event. very comfy. got lots of complements.,2
I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant  but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d,1
This top is so lovely  but runs soo big. i ordered it online and was so surprised when i tried it on at home. i'm normally a size 14  and i was positively swimming in this top. hoping to exchange for a petite sm.,2
Looks really nice on teh pictures. i tried on thre cream as this was the only color availalbe at my store (tried on per stylist recommendation(. it is very thin  you can see ripples from my belly lol  but still fairly flattering. i ended up purchasing  but it is in my maybe pile for now... wil lwait before wearing it to be sure. can't wear a grey bar with it  that htin...,2
This sweater was just what i was looking for.  it is so soft & comfortable.  the design is unique and delicate  yet doesn't shed or itch.  the decorations are not as pure white as pictured  there are several different tones of ivories & creams.  i ordered the xs  which is my typical size in retailer sweaters  as i find that most run very large and this is no exception.  it is oversize  but not bulky.  however  the decorations do add some volume  so maybe not for all body types.,2
I ordered both colors  but ended up keeping the green in petite xs b/c the red in xs was just slightly too big. both colors are gorgeous  and i agree they have a retro 70's vibe. just a tad itchy  but not enough that it would make an undershirt absolutely necessary. i'll probably just wear it alone. i think the regular size would work for most petites b/c it's not ridiculously long. i would suggest sizing down in regular if you're petite though: for instance  the regular xs fit noticeably larger,2
Seems a little small in the width and shoulders. length is fine,1
This sweater was pretty short. beyond that  when i raised my arms  the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down.,0
I own this shirt in dark green  navy  and white. it is perfect. it drapes in such a flattering way  nice weight. it shows curves in all the right ways but does not fit too snug  emphasizing every flaw. and finally... the buttons are placed perfectly so that you don't have to choose between extremely conservative or way too provocative (bra showing). well done!,2
This sweater is just the cutest- sweet and feminine with interesting details especially in the back. it's very figure flattering worn closed (there are 3 adorable little buttons) or it can be worn open over a dress or a cami. it runs very small  i usually wear a small or extra small but i bought this one in a medium  mindful of the reviews. i'm so glad i did since in addition to running small the sweater did shrink a little when i washed it even though i hand washed it in cold water. it wasn't a,2
I tried it in the store but was not the true size so i ordered online. i wore it only once so far and got lots of compliments. very unique design.,2
Based on the two reviews on this skirt and  for the sale price i purchased the small--i 'm usually a large/extra large. i carry my weight in the middle  and this skirt stills works. very sofisticated striping  slimming! i haven't experienced any slipping  but i haven't worn it for any great length of time yet. there are numerous ways to create chic looks.,2
The collar from a distance looks like it has seen better days (very scruffy)  but it is so silky soft. and the slight sheen to the jacket is a nice twist to an ordinary army type. the fabric is definitely thinner than i expected  but it&#39;s also softer and better for layering.,2
I got a small mauve. the fit is great and the length is perfect for me  just few inches above my knees.  cute and cozy! what more can i aske for!?,2
"I was looking for a shirt of this style. i thought it was very cute  but it is not ""red' as advertised. it is really a brick orange-y color  which is definitely not what i wanted. very disappointed. sent it right back.",0
I chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure  but was disappointed. the fabric is a beautiful soft  fine silk  but unforgiving. the cut is not truly a wrap  and  with a fixed thin elastic waistband  was too short waisted for me. while the model looks elongated  the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections... not flattering at all. while i was drawn to the shape for my body type  it may be better suited to another. happy hunting!,1
Today was my first visit to our new store! the sales person had this on and i liked the medium tones of the colors. many times i hesitate to order because i never know if the brand will run small and this does not. if you wear a medium in michael kors shirts  order medium.,2
I love the fit of this sweater. i recently had a baby and am a little self-conscious of my stomach area. the sweater  in my usual size s  hides my problem area without being big and boxy. the weave seems like it will be prone to snags  so i'll have to be careful.,2
I tried this in the store and i like it - nice and soft  good basic design that will pair with many pieces. but i decided to wait because of the price. i'm sure i would get a lot of use out of this top  but ultimately it didn't thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase. i bought a sweater that was on sale instead. still  a very nice top. i may buy it eventually  especially if it goes on sale.,2
I love this! i can dress it up with a sharp white button down and skirt or match it with grey leggings and boots for easy sunday's.,2
I was looking for something to wear over a spirit football shirt and this was the perfect piece. it's light weight and the material is super soft. you can wear it tied or untied.,2
I had no idea this was considered sleepwear until after i bought it. i saw it in the store and promptly tried it on  it is really flattering. i wear it as a sweater dress on a regular basis. it is really comfortable  and is something you could dress up with booties or be more casual with cute tennis shoes like keds. i get compliments on it all the time. i also like the slit a lot.,2
"Stylist at my local retailer recommended i try on this top. as soon as i put it on  i was amazed at how pretty it is. i'm 5'3"" and curvy size medium and the fit is true to size. i would say if you are between sizes  you may want to size down. i didn't have any issues with the lace and the slight v-neck falls perfectly on me. no need to wear any cami.   my only concern was how wrinkled the top was. i requested to have the blouse steamed before i left the store so that i could see if all of the wrin",2
I buy almost ever top tiny puts out and so i grabbed this one in the last tops sale since i'm a sucker for embroidered flowers. everything about it is gorgeous except it is so flimsy i can't even believe it. like when i held it up in the dressing room  i could see through the entire shirt  front to back  before even putting it on. once on  i could see everything through it. i actually thought i was going to tear the thing to pieces trying it on  it's so frail. i own so many tiny shirts and while,1
I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined  baggy  cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!,0
I am 5'5. 125 pounds  size 4-ish (sometimes a 4  sometimes a 6)  athletic build. these pants fit great except they are pretty large around the waist  about 2 extra inches of space. i don't think the problem would be fixed by sizing down since only the waist was large. i will need to get them tailored.,2
"This is the first one piece swimsuit i've owned since i was a toddler. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs 34b bust with short torso and athletic built legs...so i wasn't sure how this would fit. was i ever surprised!! i bought the size small in the mint chevron pattern. the material is substantial but not overly thick. it is double layered and the cups are padded for extra coverage. it was a little tight to pull on but after having it on it conformed to my curves like it was cut to fit them. the top offers an",2
Love this zip cardigan with removable faux fur. it did not look like much on the hanger but once on it is soft   rich and just adorable  it can be dressed up or down  perfect for a finishing piece over a dress to wearing with jeans and skirts. the fabric is soft but substantial . the only negative for me is the zipper sticks a little. a plus it is a ivory shade and is a good basic. i chose my typical medium and fits perfect . 34 dd chest for reference. sale price plus promo made this a winner. i,2
"I ordered the black 2 months ago  it was on back order  and i jsut received it finally. the fabric is super soft  itried on both xxs and xs and could keeo either one. the ""v"" in front where it crosses is low  so most people do need a cami underneath  but you could probably do without for ultra sexy look (not my style  but could be done). i plan on wearing this with skirts  deresses and slacks... i saw a commet on the lighter color  not sure  but love this one in black for sure@",2
This top is very cute. it is a high low top that i wasn't expecting  but love it. the picture doesn't do it justice it fits closer to the body than on model. fits true to size usually a small and this one fits well in small. got at a ridiculous price which is an added bonus. will get a lot of wear out of this top.,2
I also agree that this piece ran very small. my normal size did not zip up. i sized up a size  and it pulled across my thighs. i sized up two sizes  and it fit as i had hoped it would. if you get the right size  it is beautiful on. the colors are so fun  and i love the side slit. i bought it to wear to work with a blouse or blazer  and it is definitely a statement piece.,2
I saw this shirt online first and immediately knew i wanted to purchase at least two colors. i went to my local store for the mother's day sale and tried it on in the black/white and the coral/navy. i purchased both colors. i actually wanted to get all three but had some other items i prioritized over the teal/white. it fits great and is super comfortable. i have been wearing the black and white all day today and sadly  it is already pilling and doesn't seem to be holding up very well (photo giv,2
I tried on the xs and the shoulder are fit  but the body seemed so wide on me  it took me over... i don't know if xxs would have worked  but it is not available (and petite either). fabric is soft enough for denim  color is nice  overall  really pretty dress  just unfortunately big.    and i have wide shoulders.    30dd chest  26.5 in wasit  big legs  115 lbs.,2
Loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape.   looks great on. the tie in front adds to the dress.     i love to wear with tan knee-high boots.,2
This jacket is really cute! however  the mesh is really fragile. i've had the jacket for a month and noticed a huge tear down the back shoulder. it doesn't fit me tight so i'm not sure how it happened. every time i wear it i'm super paranoid about snagging it on something. like i mentioned before  the jacket is cute. it's lightweight and the design is unique. but if you want to get more than an occasional wearing out of this then don't bother. i'm hoping i can return it otherwise that's a lot of,1
I typically take a m or a l in retailer tops/sweaters  so i ordered one of each  as this has been on back-order for forever. the medium was swimming on me - and i have a very athletic frame  with huge traps and biceps. i could have easily taken this in a small and still had plenty of length in the sleeves - and i have very long arms.   ---------  this sweater is thick and heavy. there's no way here in atlanta it can be worn anytime other than spring and the occasional very  very cool summer night.,2
I purchased both colors offered and love this light weight full of neat detail piece to layer with other tops. the material is very soft and stretchy making it easy to wear over another item. i love the little shirt tail detail in back along with the drawstring trim in front. another piece that i am sure i will wear for years to come and the fit is true to size. thanks antro!,2
I really loved the material and the feel of this item  however it does run very large. even though it is meant to be loungewear it is great as a top with skinny jeans or leggings.,2
I love this jacket. it's the prettiest and most stylish jean jacket i've ever owned. the sleeves run small. i'm an xs but chose a small so i can button it and wear thin sweaters underneath.,2
I like the soft green color  the chino fabric and the casual vibe this dress exudes. perfect for spring and early summer. runs tts but may be snug for bustier gals. wish this had pockets.,2
I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.,0
"I love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight. i have never had this problem before. i ordered a petite 0 and petite 2. for reference i am 5' 4"" tall and 117 lbs. the length is perfect and i really like the style. if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite 0. the petite 2 sleeves were no looser. sorry that this did not work for me.",2
Loved this vest when i tried it on in the store  and ordered it during the last sale.   i usually wear a medium  and the xs/s fit much better than the m/l.   getting excited for fall!   now if the weather would cooperate  so i can wear this cute new vest!,2
I didn't hate it  but i don't love it. i purchased it in 2 colors b/c i thought i'd fall in love. it is just ok. maybe it's b/c i have a larger chest  but i felt like it was too small in the chest area and too loose elsewhere. not the maxi fit i normally go for. however  the material is great and it's a simple sunday dress to lounge around in and run errands comfortably.,2
"I bought the m/l (5'4"" 130lb) and love the way it hangs and the length  and the fact that it can be worn over a lightweight top. the color and feel of the fabric are very nice.",2
This dress is super sweet  but also unique with the reversed fabric on the skirt. it is true to size  unlike a lot of retailer clothes that seem to be boxy/run big. the fabric bunches a little bit at the waist though -- that's my only complaint.,2
"Dear creatures always has sizing issues. they run the gamut of bust-problems. i'd been salivating for this dress for a long time so i really did my homework. at 5'7""  130-135 lbs  34c  28"" waist - typically a 4 in dresses... i bought the small. each dress is cut from the same fabric  leaving each dress's color swatch placement to be randomly determined. as a result  i've seen some dresses have only pink  purple  and green. i lucked out and got every color represented. so the dress you see may no",1
This dress is very lovely - ivory fits as pictured (slightly below knee) in ivory not as the black is depicted (much shorter). fits a little larger than expected and material is very stretchy.,2
I love this shirt for a throw on and go.  hangs nicely and fits great.  colors are more vibrant in person.  i love mauve  i think they do a great job with their designs!,2
Beautiful dress  just like wearing a night shirt!!  great flattering fit for most figures!! wonderful color love the bell sleeves.,2
Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!,0
This dress has style and a delicate balance between design and the beauty of the material.,2
"I ordered the black & white  00 petite. i'm 5' 2""  96 lbs. and i order petite sizes all the time. the length for the size i ordered is about 23"" (on the back  from neckline) which is great for me; however  the length on the sides is way too short. the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only 9.25""  so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans. not at all the way it shows on the model. i would order 00  regular length  but then the sleeves will b",1
Loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer.,1
Fit is perfect. body slimming. i'm glad i purchased it.,2
Perfect little summer tunic that is very flattering. paired with a skirt  jeans or cropped black pants- this top is perfect! the cut in the front is not overly deep- so a cami is not necessary. i am usually a l or xl or 12 in retailer tops and i have a 10 in this top. so it is sized slightly larger than usual.,2
"I was disappointed when the dress came in the mail. it was much shorter on my than on the model in the picture. (i am 5'5"") the detail of the dress and fabric shown in the picture is not as prominent in person which was also disappointing. the dress is just average. i didn't not return the dress...it looks much better on my younger sister (who is the same height) so i gave it to her. i guess it's just not the right dress for me.",0
Beautiful overlay runs large had to return for a smaller size,2
I really like this shirt  and have gotten plenty of compliments the first time i've worn it.,2
Unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re: dry cleaning only  but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker. it did fit well -- i am 5'2  32c  107 lb and the xs petite fit very well  definitely form-fitting  not long in the arms or waist. the grey heather design was not my favorite look  actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest  and it looked like i had a huge dark stain.,1
Love this shirt. it's perfect. it's so perfect that i bought two. it is boxy but it has a lovely drape. please note  the heart is navy blue and not so black as shown. it's a thin shirt and i know it won't last a super long time  hence the back up.,2
I wear size 8   ordered a medium  fits great. nice quality  like that you can wear open or buttoned at the shoulder.,2
"This dress is a beautiful vibrant color and a classic fit and flare fit. it does seem to run a bit large  i am 5'0"" and 120 lbs. and wore a 2 petite. it fit nicely and was flattering but still a little roomy.     i added a beaded belt to dress it up for my maid of honor duties and despite all the running around  dancing  hugging  buckling the brides shoes and holding my children the lace did not fray and the shape held up beautifully.",2
I love this top! it's so hard for me to find conservative  comfortable and yet not mom-isn swimsuits. this top is amazing. it's comfortable and soft and great quality. i'm excited to use this suit this season!,2
This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.,0
Super soft shorts. i ordered them in the orange and it's a lovely soft orange. they aren't too short  about mid thigh. i found the 27 to be a little loose on the waist but i was afraid to compromise the length for a size 26. i may order the navy in 26.,2
I love this top  beautiful soft fabric   much prettier than picture  can be worn on or off shoulders. extremely flattering  falls to a perfect length   great with shorts  pants or a long skirt.,2
"Cute swing tee! fit for me is perfect. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs and i bought my usual small. length is nice. fits me just at my hips. i can wear to work and on the weekends. a little concerned  the fabric may pill so i'm taking extra care. receive compliments every time i wear either color. love.",2
"I bought a size small (5'6"" & 130lbs). it was baggy everywhere so i added a belt similar to the model and it did help some but the pockets stuck out too much. i ended up looking ""hippy"" with no butt. the material is nice and it is a nice quality. i just didn't have enough to fill it out anywhere and i felt if i got a xs it would have been too short in the crotch area.",1
This sweater is absolutely adorable! i was worried about the layers looking too frumpy but they were not - i normally wear a size medlum (8)  but i sized down on this sweater on a gut feeling and bought a small --i didn't want it to be too loose or billowy  and it fits perfectly. will be so cute with jeans but also with skirts for work! you will be so happy you bought this one.,2
This is an easy-going weekend piece. it wrinkles a bit easily but it's comfy and swingy. i was a little confused about how to wear the shirt due to the open lace pattern (nude bra or nude cami?) i'm still not sure if it's appropriate to wear without a cami,2
"I have been looking at rompers for a while but being that i'm 40  a lot of stores seem to carry rompers that are super short. i think these are the perfect length for summer (and for me!). it's cute! i am 5'5"" and 110 pounds and i ordered the xs. i docked one start because the top part seems to have a bit of excess fabric. if i pull the waist up  the top 1/2 balloons out a little awkwardly. but if i pull the shorts down so that the drawstring is resting lower than my natural waist  it looks okay",2
"The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit  albeit unique  is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape  but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5'8"" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better.",2
The essence of femininity. simply beautiful. if you begin with the pattern of the dress  you become drawn to it. then  as you look closer and see the slip with its creamy detailed embroidery  and immediately you see how the dress opens at the bodice with tiny  set buttons  you soon realize  that's not all... the bottom of this fine piece of art continues with soft  delicate  chiffon trim with a bonus layer of the most beautiful lace to finish it off. i bought it on sight and just love it. i was,2
I'm thinking that this might be a hit for the petites out there  but it didn't quite work on my long torso. the seam across the bust fell a little too high making the shirt ride up and the sleeve ended at a weird spot (not quite 3/4 sleeves  and also not long sleeves...but there is a band that makes it feel weird). the v-neck in the front is low  but offered full coverage on my 34a bust  but i can see it being pretty revealing on someone better endowed. fabric and color is nice  and it's a prett,1
This is a basic that i've been looking for for ages. i've never found such a flattering plain white button down shirt before -- everything is either not basic enough  unflattering shape  too masculine  too boring  too wrinkly  or too hard to take care of. this shirt is perfect. it is shaped to flatter  but doesn't have any finicky details. this is just a wardrobe staple  plain and simple. it is going to work hard for me  year round. i have other cloth & stone tops  and have loved them all. their,2
I wore this dress for an after party the day of my wedding day in new orleans. going to a music lounge!! seriously  i kept getting compliments!!! it's fits beautiful and i just love the different type of patterns!,2
I bought this in black and it did require me to wear a shirt underneath as it was a little sheer/see through. i usually wear an xs and i wore the same in this top. the black is very pretty and goes well with some skinny jeans.,2
I ordered this to go over a dress. i wanted the jacket short  to not cover the waist of the dress. on sale  i think it is a great bargain. the sleeves are long on me  but i rolled them  which i thought was intended since they are lined. the medium fit me. i am usually an 8 in tops. the ivory color is almost a pure white.,2
This is a great shirt but it was big for its size. i'm also short so maybe the petite size would have fit me better,1
This is so cute with a shirt or tee under neath. the look is better with a shirt underneath. very adorable for many occassions. i ordered the petite sizing b/c i like my pants more cropped.,2
This is the perfect fall/winter sweater. i bought it in red and i would get another one in the green color if it weren't sold out in my size. love it!,2
I love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress. unfortunately  it just didn't work for me. i'm a larger  busty lady (size 14) and i tried on the xl. it fit fine  but did absolutely nothing for my figure. it just kind of hung on me. even with the belt tie i still feel like it didn't accentuate my waist line. i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure.,2
Beautiful top but runs a whole size small. gave to my daughter who loved!,2
Love this sweatshirt! will look great with gray pilcro jeans i bought recently. xs fits perfectly and i am usually a s or xs.,2
This is really cute - it has a boxy look and bell-like sleeves. the knit is chunky and so very soft. i didn't want to take it off. i purchased an xs in black. it's gorgeous. my beige bra shows through so i will need to wear black or a camp underneath. it feels really heavy - in a good way - and it feels like it will be really warm. the black has a velvety look to it. i'm smitten. i should also mention that it did feel cropped to me - i know i read other reviews that said it wasn't cropped. i fee,2
It fits perfectly  slim but not clingy  and it has a beautiful pattern/texture to it. its surprisingly warm for how thin it is and its a great layering piece.,2
"This wasn't for me. i have a short neck and am 5.3"". the length was fine on the one i tried on  but other proportions were off. it was too big around  in the middle  yet tighter at the bottom. on me  this made it resemble a large bag. the neckline stood up on mine. even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model  it still felt like a whiplash collar (coming up over my chin). i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft.",0
"I adore the tiny brand blouses! this one is lovely  and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy  embroidered material  very pretty indeed. this probably is equally stunning in the nude color  but it doesn't show well somehow online. the navy is certainly amazing  and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans. i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off. the large fits me perfectly  although i am a medium in most all other tops. 5.1""  130 #  3",2
I can't say enough good things about this piece. high quality in structure and design. when i initially put it on i worried that i might have ordered a size too small. so i was pleasantly surprised to realize this dress fits like a glove but has enough give in all of the right places to let you eat  dance  breath  etc. i received tons of compliments. of note  i am 128 lbs and 5/5 - i wore a size 4. wanting another event that i can wear this to as i wore it to a work xmas party.,2
I really like the dress  the material  the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun. however  the neckline is a bit to low  and a cami is necessary  at least for me. the material is very sheer  which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee).the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off. there are no zippers or buttons. getting it on is easy  not so when taking it off!,2
This romper is extremely well made and the colors are even more beautiful in person.  however  i found it to run extremely short in the torso.  i couldn't get my arms through the sleeves after stepping into it without ripping the garment.  for reference i'm 5'9 with a slightly longer than average torso.  i ordered my normal size m.,1
I bought this shirt in a size small. it fits the same as it does on the model. it's a comfortable cute shirt. wish the other colors were available because i'd order another one.,2
This top is very comfortable and really cute on. the material is super soft. i bought the white and am very happy with it  but it is a little sheer so i have to wear a cami with it. i would definitely recommend!,2
I bought this top in white and my usual size large based on other reviews.  the sleeves are wonderfully long enough for this tall girl  which means that they are likely very long on shorter gals.  i love the style of this t.  the white is slightly see through  but with a nude color bra works ok. i do wish that it didn't cut up so high on the sides.  this probably isn't an issue with shorter people  but i need to wear something under it to avoid showing skin.  i've tried a white camisole under an,2
Purchased as a gift  but needed to return due to recipient weight challenged in past 6 months. heavier material of neutral tone ( with detailing of epaulets) pairs well with dresses  skirts  jeans  jeggings and whatever style of boots. veratile garment and will re-purchase for self in future.,2
This tunic is a wonderfully updated look. it's cinched just a tad at the waist which gives it a great line. i paired it with a pair of citizens of humanity crop jeans. terrific look!!,2
This top would have been better if it had a stretchy  fabric. being large breasted makes this top a little tight. still so pretty so i'm keeping it. makes me look a little less chesty.,2
Just a little scallop makes this top special.   if your on the edge of a 10 i suggest sizing up.   fabric crisp-well made and worth full price,2
Cute colored jeans.  ordered the sky color & when it arrived   the color was a medium moss green color.  the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them.,2
After eyeing this product online for awhile  i was able to try it on in store. i'm so glad i did  because while this dress is lovely  it is clearly not designed for my body type. i have a small rib cage and a large bust (32h ) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me. additionally  the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders  which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible. the fabric was gorgeous and soft  and the,1
Such a pretty blouse  drapes nicely though it is a little on the large side. i got my usual medium and had to fix the straps a few times  but a fun summer top that makes you feel super feminine. maybe i could have sized down but i got it online on clearance so i didn't have the chance to try on another size. still love it!,2
I bought this blouse in a size 4 (my normal size) to pair with winter white slacks and gun metal pumps. it was a hit. i felt beautiful and professional. and received many compliments at work as well as at an after work gathering the quality is surprisingly sturdy given the lace work. the collar and cuffs really set the design off. this top is much more impressive in person.,2
I usually wear a 6 and ordered two other skirts at the same time. the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size 2. very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it.,1
Very versatile tank.....i will wear it with slacks  skirts  culottes  jeans. it is soft; and the pattern is more noticeable than in the picture. i ordered the white; and i may order the black too. i am 5'4''  130 lbs. ordered in small. the armholes are perfect - no gap at all.,2
"I love this dress for fall. it is slightly sheer  so i would recommend wearing tights or a slip underneath  but it is lightweight enough for fall that i can transition the dress into the season as it gets colder. one note -- i am 5'1""  and was required to size down to an xs in this dress due to length. the xs is perfect for work  as it hits me slightly above my knees.",2
I got the blue & it is so cute! i'm a very consistent 2-4 & i ordered a size 6 & that fit well. the a-line does stick out farther than it shows in the photos so i'm having that taken in some...looked like a triangle. it's definitely worth the price & super flattering!,2
"This tee shirt is just adorable. i found it at a local retailer and decided to try it on - and just loved it! i happened to walk out of my dressing room while wearing it  to talk to my daughter who was shopping with me and three customers in the hall said"" that is so cute!"" and went to find their own. i bought the ivory color  but the other colors are really nice as well.    the fabric is substantial  soft and thick. the little ruffle at the shoulder makes a cute statement  but is just fun and not",2
So this shirt is very cute  i like the drape (if you can get it arranged properly)  but it is not black  more of a charcoal bordering on heathered navy. i wear all black so it quite obviously stands out as a different color in my closet. i am keeping it  thinking i will wear it with leather  since it is flattering and the keyhole is something different. i am a true medium and bought the medium and it fits fine. a little shorter in the back but not a deal breaker.,2
Very well made and would flatter the right body type. i sized up to a medium (normally size 6)  but the front part where the wrap came together did not cover me. the only thing you could see was the grey liner. i'm not sure this one was not sewn incorrectly  or it ran terribly small. i have had success with bailey 44 in the past so maybe this one was just not for me. the quality of the fabric and design are well done.,2
This is a super cute top. the online image does not do it justice. the scalloped edges around the arms give it a flirty and feminine look. i got lots of compliments when i paired it with the shorebird pencil skirt. the material is thick enough to not make it see-through and it's pretty tts.,2
Love the sleeves - good length and fit. it's a basic tee that has added flare.,2
I love the look and design of these pants. i'm 5'1  110lbs and i ordered a 25p and still had to get them hemmed to even fit like pants. on the model  these look cropped but mine were even too long to be pants when i got them. i love the pant but if you are a petite  be ready to need alterations to the length!!,1
"The fabric and color is stunning. very well made. i'm 5'8"" and this romper works fine. it is long enough in the body. true to size. love it!",2
"The textured marled stripes on this top are so soft and give this pullover the edge it needs. a few people have asked me where i bought this from and i've only worn it twice. fits like the photo- i'm 5'2"" 115lbs and bought the xs.",2
Love this sweater! i purchased both the green and gray versions and will wear them constantly this winter. although some reviews were critical of the feel of the yarn  i do not find this to be a problem... so happy with these products! for reference to size  i bought the m and am 5'11... the sweater hits me exactly where it does on the model.,2
I have been looking for flares that are not tight through the thigh and these are definitely them...but for me they were so long that to hem them would ruin the style of the pants. i'm 5'5 and have long legs but i would need a high heel to maintain the intended style  and that's not what i was looking for. otherwise  beautiful.,2
I love this stylish sweater. i ordered black. it is very soft and comfortable. i wear it with snaps open or closed. looks great either way.,2
I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen  but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.    at first glance  i knew i wouldn't be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy  single layer of unlined  unstructured fabric  to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt  i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim,0
These pants overall are very comfortable  but have an unusual fit. they tend to run a bit short  and i always have to get pants hemmed shorter  so if you have long legs or like more draping  you probably won't like these. they also ran a bit large in the waist and thigh  a bit puffy  i had to size down in order to get a good fit. very good quality  and cute design.,2
"I have this sweater in ivory and raspberry. it's gorgeous. holds up well on had wash cycle also. it's so flattering. i'm so so happy i bought theses. i am 5'8""  athletic build and a normal medium  this runs large. i bough smalls.",2
I find that petite gals with short ( muscular) legs can have a hard time finding cropped pants that fit right. the flare on these makes the pants oh so flattering. the material is nice and thick and holds you in. the colors and patterns are beautiful fall colors  quite lovely and subtle  there is a nice stretch to the pant  the waist has nice closures  can't wait to weer these! i ordered the 0p and htey fit perfectly. (115 lbs  26.5 in wiast),2
I have been staring at these shorts since they first appeared and finally decided to treat myself to them for my birthday. when they came in the mail i was so excited and they in person are even more beautiful and well made then in the picture. but be warned these shorts are rather short so if you don't mind showing a bit of leg these will be right up your alley.,2
Looks much nicer in the photo. i expected a much higher quality fabric. this fabric truly felt cheap. i expected a nicer dress for the price. the fit was unflattering on me. sent it back,0
This is a great skirt to add to your closet. i love it. it is comfortable  soft  and has detail to it. i enjoy wearing it for work or a night out.,2
This is comfy and casual and fun to wear.  moss ombrã© is darker and less ombrã© than pictured  so i wish i had gotten the other color way instead.  i can see myself wearing this for running errands  grabbing take-out and other important things like hanging out on my couch.  definitely size down or this will look too wide & boxy.,2
Flattering  flirty  bright  beautiful romper. i wish it come in other colors because i want more!!!!,2
This knit shirt is too thin  as most knit shirts i find are. i got this in the white  and was excited to try it on due to the fitted cut and cap sleeves. the upper part was great but the waist was too large for me  and was actually too long. had to return  especially for the cost. i purchased the xxs   which normally fits me.,1
This pair of flare is just what i have been searching for. the color is a nice vintage blue. i love the fit of the flare however please keep in mind these do run long and larger that size.,2
I've already worn this dress 4 times and i bought 3 weeks ago. easy to wear  comfortable and flattering. i love and wish it was available it more patterns.,2
I am totally on the fence with this shirt. like the other reviewers  i sized up because my normal 14 was too tight in the chest (a common problem for me). the arms are strangely tight and i didn't get much more room in the bust with the 16. but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny. this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side. i love the pattern and material though  so i'm going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart,1
I love the lace up design and bought the red xsp  fabric is a bit thin and mediocre quality  but over all happy with purchase. wish this top came in navy and white as well. even a navy/white stripe would be a fun option too. thanks you for offering this top in a petite size. :),2
I got this in the color listed as pink. it's not a usual pink. the fit is good--not too tight and not too loose. the length is good for a tee.,2
These look nothing like the picture! they are super high-waisted & longer than they look in this picture. i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90's that just fit terribly. i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs & they are far from it. the color was also much lighter than shown in picture. super unflattering & just not for me. they're going back...,0
The sweater is thinner than i expected but very cute so i'm keeping it. it seems well made so i'm not expecting easy snags  it washed well.,2
I am tall and typically wear a size 10/12  so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted. but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a cover-up than a tunic. it fits like a poncho. with my arms at my sides  it fit me similar to the model picture. but if i lift my arms (to use them)  then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me. the reason for that is that it doesn't really have sleeves - it's more like hol,0
Someone recommended to size up if u have large breast and i am glad i did! it fits like a dream! this is the cutest dot dress i have ever tried.,2
When i read car coat  i expect a little more weight. it really is just a thin  long blazer. also  the colors appear different online. i expected a red/maroon with bue and white stripe  so maybe i mis-read completely...? it is actually brown/mustard/beige combo. not what i expected  so it will be a return.,1
"For me  this skirt runs a little large. my waist is smaller than my hips so i was able to order a small  which fits perfectly. i'm 5'5"" and the length hits at the right spot  too  so there is no need for hemming. i have yet to wear the skirt  but i anticipate that it will be a great piece to transition from summer to fall with an easy switch of the shirt and shoes. can't wait to get a lot of use out of this one!",2
I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews  but as you can see  the dress didn't live up to them. i ordered a size 8  and maybe a 6 would've fit better  but i'm not going to find out. the sheer area on the model really stands out; it does not in real life. there were loose threads throughout  and there really shouldn't be at this price point. i was going to wear this to a wedding  but as a member of the wedding party  i don't think it would picture well at all. i'm sorry that it's headed,0
Bought this in the silvery grey color in the store yesterday  and i have to say the photos don't do this top justice. it hangs beautifully  is nicely lined  and is well made. i will leave the ties hanging rather than tied. it isn't too long  but long enough and has a nice swing. i'm short waisted and large breasted and this top is super flattering on me!,2
"After trying several sizes  including petite and regular  i am sad to return this dress. the regular sizes were too long on me (i am 5'4"") and although the petite fit me just a little short  the biggest issue was how tent like it fit me. i wanted it to look like it does on the model but i just couldn't get the fit. usually i have great luck with cloth & stone.",1
I am so glad i did not miss out on these jeans. i am new to pilcro and am finding they fit me so well!,2
If you have muscular thighs  like me  these won't fit well. i'm usually a size 8-fitted/10-relaxed  i bought these in a large and the shins were the most relaxed part. had to return for not fitting well. but the quality of the product was nice.,1
Fit  length and design were perfect. i took this skirt on a recent business trip and it transitioned perfectly from meetings to cocktail with an accessory change.,2
Super cut but easily wrinkles. eg. i ironed it  got dressed  then bent down to tie my daughters shoe and the whole front bottom was super wrinkly. i thought that it'd go away but it didn't... just got worse by the time i got out of my car at work... front and back were noticeably wrinkled all day.,1
This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting. the material is stiff and rough. the skirt is also loud. you can hear it swishing when you move  and not in a classy way. it feels like you're wearing a very long tutu. also  the pattern isn't quite as pretty in person. they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow.,0
I saw this t on sale and ordered it. i had second thoughts  thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have. well  i got it today and am thrilled. the fabric is so soft  a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good. the fit is the fit we all want in a great t  nice fit  not too baggy  not too tight  and it is so flattering. it doesn't show off my tummy as so many other ts do. i can wear this with jeans or a skirt. so glad i got it!,2
The embroidery and side zip were well constructed. the fabric holds onto wrinkles and creases  so after a period of sitting  there are several creases pointing to one's crotch area. this isn't too noticeable  but definitely makes this a more informal garment.,2
These cords are beautiful in the wine color and fit very well! i am 5'1 and got the petite size and felt they were a little to short  i know they are cropped flare but they hit me at a weird place. hindsight  i probable should have ordered then one size up!,1
I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however  the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else.     sadly  dress had to be returned.,0
This shirt spoke to me  as soon as i entered the store! i love the colorful plaid  the flattering cut  and the light  airy material. at very least  i think this will be a three-season go to!,2
Loved this top! it's an a-line shape which is very flattering. thick enough for winter with a coat but light enough for spring still.,2
This dress was adorable & fit great! regrettably  i had to return it since it wasn't lined.,2
I knew i wanted this top the moment i saw it  so onto my wishlist it went until it went on sale! it fits beautifully in my normal size and i love that it already has a coordinating tank top. i get compliments whenever i wear it- think hd in paris might be my new go-to!,2
The fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird. the top was fine but it became a bit tent-like in the waist. the material doesn't feel great either.,1
I thought this dress was very cute on the model  however it was way too tight across the chest for me. going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else. also  fabric wasn't great.,0
This is  like many reviewers stated  a very flattering and nice dress. the sleeves were particularly great  because they are slightly longer than most of this type and went past the meaty (for lack of a better word!) part of my arm  only exposing the slimmer bits. it looked great on me  and i imagine it would on most people. i just did not like the handkerchief hem....too young  too trendy? i don't know  when you're in your 40s  you start to feel ridiculous in certain styles! i just didn't feel,2
"I'm usually a 6 in dresses and the 6 here fit okay. loose but still flattering a little long for a sundress. i was unhappy with it looking a little frumpy and being so loose under the arms all my bras showed . i took it back to the store and after reading the reviews here decided to try the smaller sizes...well multiple dresses later i ended up buying a size 2 petite!!! and i'm 5'9"". the 2 reg and petite still had the loose gathering look to the top but both fit much better under the arms so tha",2
This seems like a simple tank  but the shape of it is super flattering. it kind of soles in at the seam  and the shoulders are just adorable and sexy at the same time. i love the detail in the straps  coloring is neutral enough  adn the fabric is very soft... i am glad i finally tried it on  jsut didn't want t pay full price  but broke down as sizes are selling out (smaller sizes  i am usually xs petite and that is gone  so is xxs  so went with xs). i am 115 lbs and 30dd for reference...,2
This is such a fun dress to pull out during the summer. it is beautiful and i receive numerous compliments whenever i wear it. also  it is pretty lightweight  so it stays cool.,2
I love this blouse  i've received so many compliments on it. unfortunately i just got it back from the dry cleaners and the color completely changed to a pale yellow! it also ate away some of the fabric  so now it's completely transparent... and i go to an organic cleaners!     retailer: if you can fix the fabric quality this blouse would be a classic.,1
Unique pattern. got lots of compliments! great fall accessory!,2
If you know one.september and you know what's good for you  then size the heck down. maybe even two sizes if your particularly slim or want the dress to fit tighter. any way  this dress is simply scrumptious! the embroidery at the bodice is so detailed and pretty. the layers are light and soft like silk (but it's rayon/poly) and the sleeves are sheer and voluminous. i actually prefer the sleeves rolled up because they are too long. neckline features a slit-v with two hooks to close if wanted. co,2
Definitely a good buy especially when i bought it on sale! it's warm and can be worn dressed up or down.,2
I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. i bought this jacket in m and it fits perfect! the sleeves are just the right length  it fits through the chest and hips. the leather and other material is super soft! i love the dark brown color  it's just as pictured. like someone else said  you can tuck the hanging material inside the jacket for a sleeker look. this is my new favorite jacket!,2
"I tried this on  the fit was true to size  as far as no cup size goes (32dd  got xs  was ok). the pattern i like  and was totally fine on my pale skin  but think of it  i would not likely wear this without a tank or shirt... support seemed ok too  i do like the criss-cross detail in the abck. thinking about keeping it  but i jsut don't ""need"" it right this second... dilemma.  caveat: not been tested in a workout  obviously  since i am not sure i will keep it (may chance it on sale).",1
I love this dress. i agree with the other reviewers that the rhinestone linkages do very easily get caught on the lace part of the dress and i could see it snagging very quickly. that said  i am going to keep it and hope for the best because it is absolutely gorgeous. it is not actually a true white as it looks pictured. instead we  it is more of a nude color  but it adds to the flattering nature of the dress and makes it look sheer. the embroidery is beautiful. my only complaint is that it will,2
I was not a fan. cute design but the sweater was not soft it felt thick like a weird blanket. the arms were small and the body was big... odd combo. the material didn't make me want to put it on. it went back.,0
This has been my go to top for cooler days  so comfortable and soft. i would say it runs tts with a little bit of a lose fit. i am 5'10  36c and usually wear s and the s fit me well. i could have gone down in size  but liked this to be a bit loser to wear over skinny jeans and leggings.,2
"It is hard to believe that this is called a chemise! it is a fabulous dress! this dress caught my eye in the store and i had to try it on. i went with the navy  which is beautiful and has a great pattern. i had to order a petite xs because the regular xs was loose in my shoulder area. i am petite and narrow and 5'1"". the petite xs was perfect for me. it is quite form fitting and does show curves  lumps and bumps so i wore my dress with spanx tights. it was such an easy dress to wear  looked styl",2
I really loved the colors and style of this top. unfortunately it runs a bit small and was too short on me. i'm 5'9. some mentioned they didn't like fabric but i thought it was good!,2
When i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous. i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be. they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my child's dress arms on my dress.,1
I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric  it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.,0
It's maybe a bit longer than i'd like but cute-great with slacks or dresses!,2
"The color says red but it's more like a rust. i'm 5'3"" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.    finally returned it without it making it out the door :(",0
Cloth & stone has to be one of the best brands at retailer! they consistently produce versatile  comfortable and quality pieces time and again. off the shoulder is back and here to stay  and without a doubt  this is one of the best i've tried on. the denim is a perfect  summery shade  but will transition well into fall with some darker denim or black jeans. i am 5'7  shoulders that are neither narrow nor broad  and a little busty - i got a size m and it fits great. i absolutely love my shir,2
"I love this dress! i am 5'3"" 117 lbs and ordered the size 0. the fit is excellent and is very flattering. the color is more kelly green than what is shown in the picture  and is lovely. i wore it to my 40th celebration and adored wearing the dress!",2
The print on this top is even more gorgeous in person. the fit was great  and the removable halter strap is always a plus. this swim top  however  doesn't have padding  and the material is slightly thin  so this could cause an issue for some. overall  however  it looked great. for reference  i am an a cup  and purchase the small.,2
Love love this skirt! quality is great and so comfortable. you can even do this skirt with boots and sweater in colder months! so glad i got it!!,2
I picked this up during the bf promo and very happy to find my size 10. i was watching this coat  i call this really a topper  because it is not heavy and finishes an outfit  i went up to a size 10 because it runs slim as noted in the description and the reviews. i find this piece to be a reminder of the old retailer pieces i have collected over the years ( since 2001!) my chest is a 34dd and even then the 10 is snug. i can't wait to wear this bold statement piece  i purchased the bailly 44 navy p,2
I really like the red version of this shirt. it will add a pop of color under a blazer for work or it can be easily accessorized with a necklace  for the weekend. i am 137 lbs  a 34d chest and the small fit me perfectly.,2
Love  love  love this shirt! much like last year's bordeaux shirt in this style  it's very soft  very flattering  and very comfortable. fits tts  and the fabric is a very soft  stretchy cotton  yet not too clingy around the mid section (it has a nice  flowy fit#. it washes great  doesn't pill #again  the fabric is fantastic)  and holds up really well. i bought the black with white stripes this year  but i'm tempted to get every color. it's great for layering too since the fabric is nice and thin,2
"Such a unique mix of prints but it totally works. much better and more vibrant in person. true to size. fits more like a maxi on me since i'm 5'1""",2
I saw this in the store and wanted to try it on  but ran out of time (a week or so ago). i thought i would need petite  but surprise  it does not come in petite...so i started obsxessing that i had to try it on  whcich i did yesterday. mistake  because i love it  and even if it is not peite  it workedc (with heels)  and online it already says only a few left  so my size will not make it to sale... so i bought it full price.  cut is very flattering  and colors are great. also can be worn any seas,2
This is a great cold weather alternative to a coat especially in warmer climates. it is lightweight but dense. love the color.,2
Great colors and not too voluminous. lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc it'll require a belt or something over it (looks v casual alone) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc it's a huge piece of elastic. i've literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it. lol but it's not worth it at the current price.,1
Love this big top...! will be great for hot summer days.,2
"This skirt arrived today and i love it. the fabric is substantial and can be worn in the fall and maybe even on a mild california winter day. i plan on wearing it with tights and/or boots. the fabric will go with a variety of colored tops and sweaters. it's not ""pull on styling"". it has a side zipper. fits true to size  but is longer on me than the model  but then i am pretty short. got this on sale!!",2
I needed a dress to go to a reunion party(not hs) and this fit the bill perfectly. it fits perfectly and its short but not too short. it is a great work dress or change your accessories and its  perfect for out to dinner.,2
I am wearing a bodysuit and long skirt from bhldn for my wedding  and i bought this skirt to change in to for my reception. it is perfectly elegant  yet simple. i cannot wait to wear it on my big day! it can be dressed up or down so easily! love it!,2
I had no issues with size or length. i'm 5'9 34c bust and i bought the striped shirt in a 4 and the umbrella print in a 2. the 2 was ever so slightly tight at the second button but i was wearing a heavy cotton cami. i could have worn a 2 in the striped top as well. i am broad shouldered and the shoulder seam in the size 4 dropped a little so there was plenty of room. these shirts are adorable. i usually don't like button downs but this style is very flattering. the material is light and drapes w,2
This gorgeous dress arrived today. the color is beautiful  but the sizing? way off. i cannot move my arms -- it is extremely snug across the shoulders. but  the rest of the dress is loose  as shown in the picture. if i went up a size to fit my shoulders  i'd be swimming in this dress. so  all you gals out there with anthletic tendencies: beware of this dress. it is for women without shoulders/with tiny arms. too bad. this is otherwise gorgeous & would look great worn over a sexy slip with the bo,1
"I bought this as a gift for a friend that is getting married in a few months. it's so soft and cozy  i'm tempted to keep it! i got the xs/s regular in white and was worried it would be too long but hits my natural waist (belly button) and i've got a shorter torso and am 5'4.5"". i got this during the 40% sweater sale and feel it is worth the full price. a fun piece but not one to keep you warm on a cold night  more of a cab to curb piece.",2
I loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away. i purchased a s and the fit was very off. the arms were long (which i don't mind) but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering. i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it.,0
"This dress is absolutely beautiful! i wore it in my engagement photos and it is so flowy and so beachy. you can dress it up or down and it's very comfortable as well. unfortunately  it got ocean water on it in my photos  so i took it to the dry cleaners and they lost it :-( hopefully it will come back in stock and i can buy it again. it is easily my favorite dress i have owned in quite some time. for tall people - it may be too short to wear with anything but flats. i'm 5'6"" and wore sandals and",2
Gorgeous embroidery  soft fabric  great drape  hides tummy--overall perfect.  size down.  i bought the small and i am 36dd.,2
The fabric is flimsy and not substantial. i thought it ran a little small. i usually wear a large in this style  but it was too tight.,0
This is a beautiful top.  the detail in the pattern of the fabric is gorgeous and the color goes great with jeans.  love the design of arm holes  they don't show your bra!  the only con is price  but it's a keeper.,2
"I had to order this dress in three different sizes to get it right. i'm 5'6"" and 125  but have a petite frame with curves  so i ordered the small petite; the sleeves and length were too short. then i tried the small regular  and i swam in that one; way too much fabric. the i tried the xs and it fit perfectly. it does stretch around the bust line  so wearing a red bra would look tacky as you can see through the lighter fabric  but black or nude is fine  or even a slip or a tank would cure that is",2
I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on  and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering  in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned  if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely  the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i'm 5'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer  but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous  but i'm guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes,0
Ordered the grey colored capris & they fit great. i am 5'5 110lbs and the size 25 fits me comfortably. i've recently been making a transition into more comfortable  looser style pants instead of skin tight jeans. these are great. still figure flattering  but comfortable and well made. the detail on the button section is lovely also.,2
This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life. sizing was mostly true to size for me  slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips. i'm 5'7 and 138# and ordered a size 4 (i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts.) a 6 probably would have fit as well  especially in the waist but didn't want it too big in the hips. length was perfect  to my knees.,2
Like the other reviewer said  the print is more beautiful in person. i am usually a small in meadow rue  and this fits well in a small. my only issue is that the lining hangs out from the bottom  and hangs out unevenly! hopefully i can exchange it or get it sewed up evenly.,2
I love the coh fleetwood jeans  and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans  i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods  which are a substantial weight denim  these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in  these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.,1
I actually love these jeans. i feel they run true to size. i actually love the button detailing at the bottom. makes them unique and different from the other jeans in my closet. i can wear them dressed up with heels or wear with sandals.,2
I ordered this online  with a little hesitation due to the negative reviews.  it arrived and it is beautiful!  the beading and subtle cut outs are gorgeous.  the colors of the beadwork in contrast to the nude tone of the fabric is stunning and elegant.!  the fit is very very flattering!!!!!  runs very true to size.,2
The fabric and cut of the dress is beautiful.  i am writing a review so i can share my experience regarding size. i ordered the dress in size 2  my normal size for this designer. it fit ok but was a little large in the bust area. for reference  i am a 34 a. i i returned it and ordered a size 0  which fits perfectly.,2
"Love this dress! fits tts. great fitted slip underneath beautiful lace design. i'm 5'6"" the dress (size small)  hits right above my knees. very versatile dress  may be dressed up or down depending on shoes",2
Great dress  love how flattering it is and that it has a little bit of a retro feel. the dress is well made  too!!,2
I love j brand  however the fit of these jeans was all wrong for me. they were perfect from the knee up  however they stuck out too much at the bottom. a slight taper from the knee down would have made them perfect. i had to return them.,1
I bought this blouse in ivory  which is almost white  just as pictured. it's pretty sheer (as shown in the pics) and the cotton lace insets show the top and straps of my bra. despite this  i'm keeping the blouse and will sort out how to wear it because it's so unusual and gorgeous! if black looks good on you (it's bad on me)  i'd probably go with that colorway over the ivory because it's easier to blend a black bra with a black blouse than a nude bra with an almost white blouse. the blouse runs,2
At the altar of bailey 44!  all hail the 'gathered stripes dress' because it can do nothing wrong  especially to my body.  i got the mp and this piece totally enhances what little i've got.  so happy!,2
...the print is so sharking  and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i'm a more curvy figure  and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering. ordinarily i love everything made by maeve  but this one sadly must be returned... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great.,0
"I discovered seea bathing suits last year and fell in love. i currently own two - the hermosa surf suit and the . seea zuma. for reference: i am 5'7""  135 pounds  34c  28 waist. dress size 4-6. pants 6-8. jeans 28. if you have questions about sizing  there is a great reference on seea's website on how to size. if you are taller than the reference sizing they provide  but still the same measurements as another size mentioned  they suggest sizing up as the suits are typically made for surfing/padd",2
This dress is a bit longer than photographed but i was totally ok with that. the skirt is also a bit fuller which makes the dress more formal. it's really well made and great material. i'm 5'6 123lb and bought a size 4.,2
"This dress is so pretty in person. the colors are great - the blue and green and just beautiful in person. the fit is tts. i happen to have a blue belt and could style it just as the model has  but really it doesn't need it. it is super flattering even without a belt. i am just a hair shy of 5'5""  and i cannot wear flats or it would drag the floor. but adding a 2 1/2"" wedge is perfect to keep it off the floor (no hemming needed). i don't usually pay full price  but i am glad i did in this case.",2
"I absolutely love these pants. i got the yellow and it is a beautiful  soft color. the fabric is soft and flowing. i am 5'1""  102 lb and the 0 petite fit perfectly. some stated they are too long even in petite but i disagree. the patch pockets are darling. don't hesitate to try these pants out!",2
This top is fabulous! so comfy and the lace at the top is just right. it does run a little big but drapes so well it looks fine...i got the plum but tempted to get the ivory   especially at the sale price! a steal...,2
This is a great skirt. i am always on the lookout for machine washable clothes that are fun and work appropriate. this skirt is really flattering on my body. the only thing that's a little off is the tie at the front but it's still really stunning on.,2
Loved this blouse but tried on size 8 (my size). waaaaaay too big. tried a 6 - still big - but the 4 was perfect. the only problem was that it did get a bit shorter in length but also ended up a little more fitted which i really liked.,2
This top is true to size and fits perfectly.  color is very natural.,2
When ordering this product  i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however  these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty  however  i wish they made them more true to size.,1
This top is a great addition to your summer wardrobe! it looks great with jeans/jean shorts. it's relaxed and comfortable with a super flattering cut. the straps and low cut in the back add a touch of sexy as well.,2
This top is really pretty & i think i will be happy when i pull it out in the spring to wear it. the only complaint is that the front is very sheer. you have to wear an under shirt of some kind.,2
After losing a lot of weight i thought i'd try a pair of skinny jeans and since pilcro is my favorite jeans brand  i bought my usual pilcro size but wow. these are just way too tight. they pull on like leggings or tights  clinging to every part of your leg - there isn't even a bit of looseness around the calves and my lower legs have never been big. i kept thinking i'd just lose more weight and they would fit better but that isn't happening either (the fit) so these are going to my daughter who,1
Love the blue color  different than many blue tops i own. i thought it was going to be a thicker knit and perhaps more stiff  but it is soft and a lighter knit and it makes the shape once on much more flattering.,2
This dress is lovely. timeless style  heavy fabric  only con? a deep front v. i couldn't wear this to church. i'm a 36d.,2
"Purchased this in-store today. i'm normally a small  but tried on x-small before trying on my regular size. the x-small fit perfectly. i'm 5""5  135 lbs  with wide hips and petite derriã¨re. the dress fit well  slightly hugging my bottom. while i don't like things that draw attention to my bottom  with an outward tug or two of the stretchy material of the dress  it fit perfectly. sweater dresses tend to be bulky  so it makes sense to down size. definitely a nice addition to my closet.",2
This skirt fits true to size and sits on the natural waist nicely. i've paired it with black  and the contrast is very nice. the material is thick enough for winter  but will also work for the fall months  too.,2
Nice material  hits high waisted  mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good  you couldn't tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer.,0
Thanks to the vertical stripes  the adjustable neckline  the bow that cinches the waist  and the free flowing skirt  this dress is extremely flattering. the compliments i received when wearing this dress back that up! i was unsure if i should order a medium or large because i typically wear either/or depending on the dress style due to my hips. i ordered a large which fit thanks to the adjustable neckline and adjustable waist  but a medium definitely would have worked just as well for me (i just,2
These run so small!! i was dissapointed with having to return my pair. i'm hoping they are replenished back in stock so i can get the proper size.,2
"Cute design. runs big in neckline  falls off shoulder exposing bra straps. fabric is very thin. sloppy look on short petite frame. 5'1"" 142lbs 34-36 c/d. purchased a medium. haven't washed it yet  but the fabric doesn't look like it will hold up well. i have kept it to wear as a sleep shirt with thin gray sleep sweats.",1
These two blouses are probably my best purchases anywhere in some time. fit is perfect  quality is great and both will be worn many times this summer and into the fall. unique from the all other tops i have seen lately.,2
This blouse is so pretty! i love the neck tie which gives it interest and won't look boring on it's own. i'll wear this all-year round. i ordered an xxs which fits perfect.,2
"I bought these assuming they would be the same as a pair of pilcro stet ankle jeans i bought a couple of years ago. this pair has less stretch than my older ones  so they are a bit tighter. i'm 5'2"" and these are more like a perfect length regular jean (rather than ankle). i always have trouble finding jeans that fit my curves  but smaller waist. these are a bit big in the waist  with the butt and legs fitted. all-in-all they are a nice looking durable denim that flatters.",2
"Just didnt like the fit. it ""puffed out"" in front  so that wasnt very flattering. i have an hourglass shape  and this was not a good fit for me.",1
I wanted to love this warm dress because the colors and the material are beautiful. unfortunately  i couldn't make the fit work. for reference  i am 5'3  110 pounds and usually wear an xs in retailer clothing. like other reviewers  i found the xs to be a bit tight around the arms  and i don't have particularly large arms  so i ordered the sp  hoping it would be roomier and shorter (the regular length came down to mid-knee). unfortunately  the sp was enormous; it was in no way a petite. it was as l,1
I'm 5'9 and wear a size 12. this dress runs tts though there is no stretch to it  found the bust to be a tad tight (38c). it is light with good movement. i did not find it short waisted and i thought the proportions were correct. the length was just long enough to make me feel comfortable wearing it. i'm looking forward to wearing it to holiday dinners this season.,2
Comfortable. flattering. i agree with other reviewers that this is great piece. i purchased the red one and it is beautiful. fits tts.,2
The perfect cardigan for transitional seasons! i live in southern vermont and i can already tell this cardigan will be in heavy rotation during the summer to fall and spring to winter transition times. has such a cute back detailing that gives you a break from your common cardigans. great quality. i'm 126 lbs 5'4 and i got the small petite and is perfect if you want it to be slightly loose but not swimming in it!,2
This tunic is a nice basic to have. it is like a light sweater knit. the arm holes are a little large and hang low but can easily be remedied by wearing a camisole underneath. nice with leggings or skinny jeans.,2
I ordered these hoping they would look like the model - but they didn't. i am small but curvy. it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly  these pants are going back.,1
This product looks great on the model  but for anyone with a normal body type  the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph  it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit  but instead i had to return it  pay for return shipping  and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed.,0
I love ponchos and the colors are gorgeous  but the pictures make it look much longer than it is. i would've loved it if i were petite but i personally don't think it's meant for taller people. such a shame.,1
"Beautifully embroidered dress.  it's loose fitting  not meant to be tailor fitted  so it would run large to you if that's what you were expecting.  the colors are gorgeous and the skirt has a really beautiful flow.  if you are hoping for a fitted look  size down one size.  there is plenty of stretch to this dress and plenty of room in the bust and waist.  i generally go between 00p and 0p  and got this in a 0p (though either would work).  it comes to just above my knees at 5'2""  110  32-24.5-32.",2
I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly  i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat  the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap  which i love.,0
I love this shirt. i have it in black and purple. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute long sleeve shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming. it is more fitted than last years style.,2
This is a beautiful skirt and such a great piece to collect from erin fetherston.  the design and cut are very flattering on a variety of body types. i have more of a curvy shape and love this type of cut to accentuate my smaller waste (rather than fitted dresses/skirts that hug).  there are several linings that help give shape and volume. the stripes are made of ribbon. it's so gorgeous  i've received many compliments. i've paired with a sequin tank and glitter keds by kate spade...it's a dynam,2
"I have been searching for months to find a pair of top-quality  slim fit  high-waisted jeans  either straight leg or flare. my search has ended with these flare jeans from paige  thanks to retailer. the fabric is incredibly soft  yet has that little ""snap"" of stretchiness we have all come to expect in expensive jeans. i also like the dark wash and the fact that there aren't those odd color striations across the hips. i bought size 27  which fits me perfectly. (virtually all my other jeans a",2
I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!,0
This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering  it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape  but alas  i did not look good in this.  the material is very nice  soft and stretchy.,0
This cardigan is lovely  casual layering piece. it's a very thin lightweight knit and pairs well with a tee or tank under it. i really like the color and the style. the longer front can drape or tie for multiple looks,2
I love the sweatshirt    clay color is very different it's a nice light fabric with nice detailed edges    although it is an oversized piece it hangs and fits well although i am petite   great light sweatshirt for spring and summer,2
"I love this skirt! i wasn't sure about the mix of the back pattern with the front but it works! it is great for work at a less conservative place and for dinners out too! the quality is great - the skirt is a fine silk  ant it is lined  so you don't need a slip. i think it fits perfectly for my body type  and while it runs big compared to typical retailer sizing  it is true to size compared to other stores in the petite sizes anyway. i am normally a 0 petite  5'2""  104  waist 24.5""  hips 34",2
"The back of this top is very unique and the embroidery looked like it would hold up. it does have a boxy shape  but it really works with this piece. i found it to run true to size compared to other pieces i have from retailer. for some reference  i'm 5'5"" and weigh 148lbs.",2
Purchased on sale and worth the $20 or so dollars. just a good basic top. scoop neck not too deep  fabric is opaque enough to not need a cami.,2
Fabric quality is good  pattern is pretty in person. very comfortable! i'm not sure if it's because i have an ample chest  but unfortunately it looked like a maternity shirt on me. it looks good from the front  but from other angles it looked bulky. i tried in both white and black  and i think the white looks better?the smocked top is more visible.,1
Definitely size down it does run large however  it is a sweet floral print made of rayon so i would dry clean as rayon shrinks. i love tunic lengths and this one is a bit longer than most tunics but for me still works. there are 2 small pleats on the front and the ruffles on the neckline are a nice touch. it is made well. i have a long black sweater that will make this work right into the fall and winter.,2
Found this cute little black sweater on the sale rack in a small and it fit perfect. it is flattering and will look great over a tank top or strappy dress. the little details of chiffon around the collar and the tiny cutout holes around the back  the softness  and the little detail on the back bottom make this a perfect go to sweater for me. i only say it runs small because it is a cropped style so expect it to be short  but i would agree that the arms are more to the snug side than the loose fi,2
"Got this dress in the blue and cream and it's gorgeous. i love that it's work and date night appropriate  but so comfy. i am 5'4"" but have very short legs  so it's hard to find a maxi dress or skirt that doesn't drag on the ground. this floats beautifully above my ankles - a little lower than on the model  but still high enough that i am totally comfortable wearing the dress without heels. i got the small and it fits great. the print is lovely - the cream fabric is speckled in gray dots in some",2
I love everything about this dress. cute  comfortable  easy to wear. it does wrinkle a little and it's not lined but otherwise  i love it.,2
I have been living in mine since i bought it! so comfy and dressier than a plain sweatshirt!,2
This dress is more beautiful in person. loved it . fits true to size . i had to return it because it was to long for what i needed.,2
Love the look and quality of this jacket. i&amp;#39;d say it fits true to size but it is way too short for me (i&amp;#39;m just under 6&amp;#39; tall). wish these came in tall sizes!,0
I love this with white leggings that skim my legs b/c it is a looser top that you can cinch at the waist. one small complaint is that the tie is awkward with the side slits  but for the sale price  i can overlook this.,2
I got the honey colored and love the color. they are very comfy and soft. i look forward to wearing them all summer,2
This tunic is so stylish and pretty. the fit is close but not clingy (5'4  116 lbs.  size xs) and the rear coverage is just right to wear with skinny jeans or leggings. the fit is flattering whether the zippers are up or down  without riding up around the waist. the cowled collar falls around the neck evenly without the bulky look that similar styles can sometimes lend. the moss color is pretty  the fabric is soft and warm yet still fairly lightweight. if the pockets are properly tucked and layi,2
"I was so excited to receive this top!!! the material and design is gorgeous but it is way way way too short!!! i'm 5'7"" with an hourglass shape/average build and it barely hit the top of my pants! it otherwise fit true to size. so disappointed!!!! and for the price  it really should be cut better.",0
These pants are a must for any girl's summer warm weather wardrobe! i tried them on in the store and loved them. but... i am just over 5' and they were too long in the xs  even with 2.5 inch heels. so i ordered them in an xs petite and they are perfect with my 2.5-3 inch heels.   i love that they are wide-legged! they look cool and are flattering! i am a teacher and plan on wearing them to work during the warmer months with a nice solid tee and a statement necklace. and of course  heels. i highl,2
I just received this swimsuit today and love it!  i was a little hesitant to order with the cutouts  but i feel it is very flattering.  i was choosing between an xs and s.  i ended up going with xs and am glad i did  i think going up would of caused gaping on the sides.    great suit  only comment is in the description i believe it said the straps are adjustable  but they are not.  also  there is light padding which i appreciate.,2
These jeans are very comfortable. i really like the high waist. just what i was looking for!,2
"Love this top. it is exactly as pictured online. it's a beautiful coral pink color - perfect for summer (i think the description says ""red"" but it is definitely pink). i love the swiss dot material  the bell sleeves  the ruffled bottom. they all work perfectly together to make for an adorable top. it almost seems as if it can be worn off the shoulder  due to the elastic neckline  but i prefer it on  as pictured on the model.     the fit is tts. i ordered an xs and that is what i usually wear fro",2
Cute  but very itchy! have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath!,1
This tank top runs big. i?m usually a xs and i ordered the xs and pxs due to reviews and the pxs is still big. i kept the pxs because it?s very cute and i love the color (ordered the canton). i?ve been taping the tank to my bra so it does not slip too far down. however  not sure if i will order this again.,2
I tried on this top in the store in a large and the arm holes were too big. i am busty and usually wear a size 10  so i usually need a m to l. i ordered a m which was shipped to my home  and it fit perfectly. really cute with skinny jeans!,2
Love this dress.  i like that it is somewhat form fitting but also has a nice swing to it.  green color is nice for summer.  bought a similar maeve dress last year and it was all cotton like and soft  this one has a soft top but a different material on the bottom.  a little scratchy and crinkly.  wish the entire thing was as soft as the top,2
I thought this coat was absolutely unique when i first laid my eyes on it  i saw it on a co-worker on thanksgiving 2015  her coat was in navy blue pattern  mine was grey  but looked very good on and let me say the way she wore the coat  it looked oversize on her. my co worker is a very skinny size xs-s woman with very slim slender curve-less figure unlike mine. we are about the same height but i'm a bit taller with curves (6ft  160lb). i normally wear size l 10. i like my outfits lose  but after,2
Pretty color  but i was hoping for a thicker  higher quality material for the price. the material is lightweight and isn't tailored well. looks kind of sloppy.,1
This is the prettiest little sweater with such nice details. but it will not work well on a person like me with a full bust (38d) even in a larger size than i normally wear. it is also very  very short in the body. i would recommend it for a petite person with a small bust though.,1
I saw this top on a store mannikin and was drawn to it by it's color and print. it looked great with blue jeans on display and a lariat necklace. then i noticed the different design on the back below the yoke. the surprise was its being pleated into very fine pleats. i liked the funky quality this added. the design is a good transitional piece to wear early fall or under a jacket. it is machine washable and that finalized the purchase of it. i bought the necklace too. i often wear a small but go,2
"I am 5 7"" 135 lbs the small fit well in the bust but no shape . it was just big and frumpy . it went back .",0
Cute top and perfect for those hot summer days as fabric is light  but not sheer.,2
Ordered this cover up in a mp but it was waaay too big so now waiting for the sp to arrive! hope its a hit!,2
"Hesitated to try it on because it was ""t-shirt dress"" and my experience has been that fabric is unforgiving for dimples or imperfections   i was wrong with this one. it's great!  color is nice. fabric looks textured bc of the dye. the neck line is perfect (i like a lower v) and the length is great bc of the side slits. i tried it on with the front panel knotted at the bottom (how it was on the hanger) and i love it.  had to get. can dress up or down  but i'd say this has mostly a casual feel.",2
I ordered this in sand and loved it so much when i received it that i went back and ordered it in black as well. it is very flattering and sexy!,2
Love love love this dress! the fit is amazing and is slimming. although the lace is delicate looking  it wears well.,2
This dress is so cozy and soft. love it! the cowl is big in a flattering way. absolutely adore the buttons that run down the back of the dress. such an unexpected detail which makes retailer pieces so special. i would layer tights and tank underneath anyway so the see through aspect other reviewers mentioned wasn't apparent to me and also wasn't as big a deal.,2
The dress is as great 'in person' as it shows in the pictures. if you usually buy petite keep in mind that you may like the regular size if you prefer the llonger look. if you prefer a shorter length go for the petite size if this is what you usually get. i am 5.3  117 lbs and tried both  xs regular and xs petite. i ultimately went with the regular size as i preferred the longer length.  everything about this dress is perfect  the color  the material  the cut. highly recommended as a transition,2
"Great pants  with a couple of quibbles.    these pants have mini blue stripes in the fabric  so in real life they look a bit more blue than they do in the photos. these are not white pants  but they would fill the ""faded blue denim"" niche in your wardrobe. and also like faded blue denim  these pants are more opaque than most lightweight white pants are these days. you would not want to wear black underwear with these  but likewise your undergarment choice would not be immediately apparent (compa",2
I was so excited to get this in the mail... and loved everything about it except for the fact that it was only as long as one inch above my navel! i don't know why it looks like a normal length on the model. im returning it.,1
Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.,2
These are the perfect higher waisted skinny jeans. high enough that there is no muffin top  but not so high they look like mom jeans. typical ag super soft fabric. they are like wearing sweat pants. so worth the extra money for the ag jeans. love the length too.,2
Such a pretty skirt. i think it's a very versatile piece. a bit heavier  can't wait to wear when it cools down more. i saw the dress that is similar to the skirt in the catalog last month and loved it too. note the skirt does not have the same shine in the fabric that the dress does.,2
The pullover is very light weight material so great for fall or spring. it hangs nicely in front and back and is slimming. i ordered a medium other than the sleeves are not as long on me as the model it fits perfectly.,2
"I never buy prints.....but this was so understated and elegant i could not resist!  just received and it is lovely!  beautiful soft hues with the softest of pattern that will look fantastic with jeans.  the buttons are beautiful and a special touch!  will be wearing this top often........pretty  soft fabric  comfortable fit and a ""goes with everything and everywhere piece!""  a must get!  i wear a medium and ordered my usual size and it fits beautifully.  love!  reminds me of a monet watercolor..",2
I bought this top in the gray color and my usual size large.   the fit is perfect.  i don't have the tight neck issue that another reviewer had.  there is an odd knitted neck that you can't see on the model since her hair covers it.  i love the softness  fit  and embroidery of the top  but was debating on returning because of that weird  stiff neck knitting.  my husband said that he really liked it  so i gave it a shot.  i'm wearing it right now and it's super comfortable. i don't notice the nec,2
This dress does run large  but i sized down from med to small and it's a great fit. the fabric is lightweight as silk sometimes is  and is nicely flowy  but might require a slip.,2
But if that works for you it is a cute pattern. this is a lighter weight sweater but good for fall.,2
I bought this jacket in a regular and returned it to the store where they had a petite  it is lovely.  i live in ca so it is perfect for an evening out.... remember not to buy this for warmth but a light cover up.  it makes an outfit out of anything else you might want to wear.  looks great with black under it or off white.... also looks great with the beautiful soft pinks that are out this season... or cranberry.... you will love it...,2
Love the design  material  and color...the sizing as listed is waaaaay off (running small). returned to store (after purchase online) 3 times to get one that fits  which was at least generally easy :o,1
I love this dress! tried it on at the store. they only had medium. while i'm usually always a medium  it fit perfectly but pulled at the bust (i'm a 38). i ordered a large online the next day. i have it now and i am extremely pleased. the pattern is unique  the length falls just above the knee and has s sexy flirtiness to it. the back button is key as it gives some contour to the dress. the side pockets are an awesome touch. you can wear this dress any season. i'm wearing it with ankle boots and,2
The skirt has a great cute design and great colors and great shape. but it runs very small and short. this company needs to provide a better fit  and large sizes if they run small.,1
I liked the simple styling of these jeans when i saw them in the store. the price is right considering what some jeans cost today. unfortunately  these are made in china. that bummed me out. they run a tad bit small but in the end i think they are more true to size because they give especially in the waist. the higher waist is a nice change. it's nice to be able to skip a belt. the denim is a bit rough after air drying so i hope it softens up.,2
Bought this back during an retailer event  because i was in the market something long & oversized to wear over leggings. so when i saw this  i thought it could fit the bill. i read the reviews & knew it was more of a soft  t-shirt-like fabric and is short when belted  so  because i'm 5'10  i was sold!  i bought the xl  because i have wide shoulders & a dd chest size.     when i got it home -- i was in love: rich garnet & so soft & comfy. then i tried buttoning it. it was just a bit too small & pul,2
"I really like the appearance of this item  and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings. it does run a little large. i am a ""true to size"" small  and this hangs on me a little  but i love the design of the back. it is so soft and comfortable!",2
I wanted a casual but special summer dress and had high hopes for this one. i normally like to try things on as it is difficult to tell fit online. when it arrived i was disappointed with this dress. it is very full in the skirt  the top fit a bit odd  not a lot of shape and not especially flattering. the fabric wasn't very exciting either.  unfortunately this one went back.,0
Well  i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined  a smaller size would have worked better  but for the price  i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn't in the picture  so no expectation  but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines,1
Fits great and the material feels great on! going to buy a second one in a different pattern.,2
There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.,0
This top is absolutely stunning. i purchased the white one. just received and it fits nicely-a little on the big side but i believe it looks better that way. this will look great with everything. it is well constructed and looks very unique. love it!,2
I love the color blocking but dress hangs a little strange on me. love the pockets  thought about sending it back and decided it is very comfortable  i will wear it but not quite what i was hoping for.,2
The shirt is quite beautiful  the lace is thick and high quality. however  i have a short-ish torso and hourglass figure and this shirt added 20 lbs. the peplum fabric below the waist hung awkwardly and poofed out. maybe this would work better for a taller person  or one who has a straighter build.,1
I love this dress! i have an hour glass figure and the dress is very flattering on me. i didn't encounter a problem with the colors or pattern as others have stated.,2
This ruffle tee is adorable on. the fabric is light but not thin and the styling is very flattering to any figure. i look forward to wearing it as a transition piece as it stays warm long into fall in the south.,2
This is way cuter in person than on model. it is a super soft and fluffy sweater. the colors are so pretty and feminine. i received it as a christmas gift and have already worn it twice. it's perfect with skinny jeans and ugg boots. i vary between xs and small in retailer sweaters. this is a bit boxy so i sized down with the xs and it fits perfect!,2
I was very pleased with this purchase. lovely print  good fit  and silky fabric.,2
This is a perfect jacket over any shirt  tee  or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything!,2
I absolutely love these shorts!!! everything about them is perfect!! i have them in almost every color. they wash beautifully. i don't dry my shorts in the dryer. they fit the same as last years'. i'm thin & pretty straight with little hips. i wear them in a size 28. i tried the 27 & they felt a little snug. i don't like my shorts tight & i like when they can hang down a little with a belt or not (like the model in the picture). i don't find that they stretch out much after wearing but that coul,2
I tried on a returned 24p in my store  they were almost the right length  but the fit was more snug than pictured here (i have muscular thighs/butt  and 115 lbs). they were nice though  kind of a skinny pant. the carbon is a dark grey  can go with anything... only gripe is the waist height is low  at least on the behind... i would certainly show if i bend down without a long top.,1
"Noticed this sweater as soon as i walked in the store. i am 5'5"" 135lbs  with an athletic build so teeter between a small and medium in tops. i spent a long time trying to decide if i preferred the small or medium fit. the sweater is a bit boxy so ended up sizing up  as the longer length seems to off set some of the boxiness. i am looking forward to wearing this with skinny jeans and boots. as another reviewer suggested  i think a denim shirt will look great underneath. rated a good in quality b",2
"Love these pants i bought them in two colors! flattering fitting!! im 5'4 120lbs 36"" hip. i bought these in size 25. sometimes i don't like petit sizing but these petite at 30"" long inseam still gave me enough length to wear with heals. there is the usual good and bad with linen - after you wear them once you need to iron because they look too wrinkled and worn. the linen is light and washed - unfortunately i don't think these pants will hold up for more than a two years. i'll love them while i",2
This dress did not show well on the hanger but thankfully it intrigued me. i love it  it's very flattering and easily dressed up for work with a heel or dressed down for the weekend. great buy!,2
I loved the shape of this sweater. the way it draped from the waist was flattering and different. the sleeves were a strange length  however  between long and 3/4 length which made it look like they the sweater was just too short for me. the color looked peachy or pink in the photo  but in reality  it was almost skin tone  which was not flattering with my olive coloring. paler women might find it attractive. the real downside for me was the fabric which was thin with the flowers mainly printed o,1
I agree with the other reviewers  this top is completely disappointing in every way  i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin .......  it runs really big  it's short and boxy  not at all like it appears on the model  this must be pinned a lot in this picture.  colors are completely dull in person  i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.  fabric feels cheap and stiff  lining is stuff and poorly sewn.  i haven't one positive thing to say about t,0
"I was hesitant about this one since i've tried cloth & stone shirts in-store and found them to be tight in the shoulders and arms. i have athletic shoulders and arms  so i didn't have high hopes for this one. i tried it on in-store and it's surprisingly true to size. i always wear m in tops and this fits perfectly. it is long  but i like that there's enough length that i can tuck it in. for reference i'm 5'3""  130 lbs  a cup  17"" across the shoulders.",2
Cute  comfortable  easy to wear  even on my hourglass figure. can't decide the best shoes to wear with this - so it doesn't look frumpy.,2
I ordered a petite medium in black  and it fit great great. some of the other reviews said it was tight  but i found it pretty loose and flowy. also felt it was plenty of coverage - wore it to work (casual workplace) and transitioned to happy hour beautifully.,2
Fits great and just as pictured. the material is very smooth and slinky.,2
Agree 100% with other reviews. this dress flares a lot so it does resemble a tent. to size down causes a problem in the shoulders. i had to keep the 8 - which is what i usually wear to accommodate my broad shoulders but i love it so much i am having it altered to taper and adding the pockets you would expect a dress like this to have. at this price i am hoping it's worth it.,2
"I?m not the type of woman that wears dresses  but oh man...this dress! i?ve been eyeing it for a while  and it finally went on sale  then the extra 30% off made me cave. got it for $115. i bought it one size smaller (8) to encourage me to not over-indulge this xmas  and if fit like a glove. for reference  i?m 36 bust  30 waist and normally a size 10 in retailer. it accentuates your curves & hugs your body while being ""sexy/conservative"". the intricate embroidery is exquisite and very eye catching.",2
It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester  slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.,1
"This dress has a flattering and fitted cut which perfectly compliments the unique eyelet fabric. it is at once elegant yet casual  perfect for the office or better yet  afternoon tea in a far flung british colony of yesteryear. which brings me to the buttons - putting on this dress makes one wish one had a ladies maid  but the effort is well worth it for this stunner of a dress. as others have said  it runs small and tight in the chest and is not for the well endowed. i am a petite 5'2"" and fit",2
This fits like a regular top for me. i can take petite on top most of the time. i bought this in a medium regular and it fits like my regular high low tees or tops. i think it's so cute on. it's light weight enough for warmer weather. i'm going to love it this spring/summer and into fall with a jacket or cardigan. another plus is it doesn't gape at the armpit which i get sometimes with regular cuts. it's not so low cut on me either  but i have a 32f (37-38ish inches) bust so that may be why? it,2
I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore  i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.,1
I have a number of sweaters from moth  and they never disappoint. the ones made with this ultra soft and warm yarn are my favorite. i bought both colors :) i wear it with jeans or dressier clothes-- i'd say it's very versatile.,2
I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large - so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly. love the length- it hits mid hip. it is more of an a-line than straight as show in the picture. the detail is fun and the sweater is well made. highly recommend it- i have received lots of compliments on this sweater.,2
I love this! great quality and flattering. i'd definitely agree that it runs true to size  as i had to size up because it was the only size available  and it is a little large in the stomach and rear  but it works well in the chest area. the v neck isn't too low and the sides provide good coverage up top. also  it covers the rear end well! material is nice and thick and the seams are good quality. super happy with this purchase  just wish it was in stock in the smaller size so it held me in more,2
This is my second pair of these because they fit and fell so good. pricey  but worth it.,2
This is a gorgeous sweater but huge. and when i say huge  i mean gigantic. i'm usually a size large and i don't even think the small would be small enough. the cowl neck and fabric overall is great (although stretches out  which is why it becomes so overwhelming) but the sweater just hung on me like a short blanket. the armholes are very big - deceiving on the model. returning.,0
I was so excited to get this dress  and it was such a disappointment! it looks so cute on the model  but it was very different when i got it. the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be  and the pattern just looked a bit strange--it stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral. the dress fit really awkwardly on the top. the straps were way too long  and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on. i normally wear a 4p  and i ordered down to a 2p. the waist,1
I was looking for a velvet dress for the holidays. this one was beutiful in color and teksture. the only problem was that it was snug in the shoulders. going a size up would have made it too roomy elswhere.,2
The material looked much nicer in the online picture. also- there are pockets which added a bulk to it that was not flattering on me.,1
This is festival dress epitomized. flowery  flowy  romantic styling. so many layers in a muted color pattern  but also retains heat since it's all polyester. good thing the skirt is swishy to air your legs out. my distress is regarding the length. petite was sold out so i bought the regular with the intention of wearing platform wedges. it's still too long! if i hem  i will lose a lot of the pretty blue pattern.,2
I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo  i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it  however  it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge  i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment  i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.,0
This tank is so light and made with great fabric. i bought this to wear over pants - black jeans  classic denim  this fall  maybe with a jacket over.   i purchased a size medium  and it is loose and comfortable.,2
I have been thinking about getting this dress for a while  but was holding out because i was concerned it would look like a sack! but i am so glad i got it  and so glad my usual size was not available! typically i'm a m or a m petite but i ordered this in a s petite. while still flowy  i think it would have been overwhelming in my usual size. i think it will be great for many occasions as the solid black can be dressed up or down. i can't wait to wear it! definitely consider sizing down.,2
"Love that this is comfy  with a subtle yet sexy vibe. had so many compliments when i wore this to work  with everyone asking where i got it! fits true to size (110lb  5'4"") and xs fit perfect. took off a star because it may look like it could get that ""fuzzy"" pilling over time.",2
Lovely  but i am sensitive to some fabrics and i couldn't bear the feel of this lace. wish it had worked  so pretty in the picture!,1
Love this top! i receive so many compliments wearing it  even from my teenage boys! runs large  but that's the style of it  very flowy. very flattering.,2
I saw this in the store and immediately had to try it on. it fits perfectly. i'm usually a size 4/6 with dresses and the small fit perfectly. it looks expensive and high quality and the print is unique. what i love most about it is that i can wear it in the winter time  layered over say.... a black turtle neck and black tights... but i think it can also be worn in the spring  especially with that flower print.,2
I tried this top on today because i was really hoping i could get the shorts and robe set. the shirt was softer than i was expecting  but when i tried it on it was an uncomfortable fit. there was some tightness in the armpit area  which is not where i would have expected it to be tight. the rest of it was comfortable and reasonable looseness so i don't think a size up would have been a good option for me. i like the design a lot so i was really disappointed it didn't fit. it is between a lightwe,1
I found this to fit really well and i've got a chest  and the hourglass to go with it. the stretch really helps it to be comfortable too. i reckon it's pretty versatile too.,2
I love this jumpsuit! i'm 5'3  122 lbs and the x-s was to big on me. i had to return and order the x-s in petite and the fit was perfect. you can wear it with heels or with slides. i wore it with a thick brown wide belt and some tan open toe shoes. i wore gold earrings and necklace. i got some many compliments and my girl friends asked where i had purchased it. and if. purse i told them retailer;),2
I'm 5'0  125 lbs  and 34d  i ordered a 6p and it fits perfectly. the color is more of a bronze mixed with gold and chocolate. the picture does not do it justice.,2
The peach color is beautiful on this jacket  and the quality and comfort is perfect. i wear a medium and the sizing was spot-on. i may get in another color if a sale comes around again.,2
This dress fits incredibly well. i loved the color and it will transition through the fall nicely.,2
This dress is perfect for my florida lifestyle because of the fabric and the design. it is not the color pictured on the web page which was a disappointment. the color is a lot duller. i tried it on in the store and found it to be tight across the chest  another lady who also tried it had the same problem. i went home and ordered a larger size. that dress was baggy and not as cute in the back. i realized because of the under slip it could be left open to the waist and work just fine. i ended up,1
I love these pants! so comfortable and the material is so soft.,2
I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium  which was just ok. overall  the top half was comfortable and fit nicely  but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo  a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c,1
This dress is so pretty and i instantly fell in love with it when i tried it on. i generally wear size 0 or 2 and opted for the 2 for more room. i know some reviewers felt that the dress ran too long at the bottom  but for me  i was sold on it because this dress is form fitting  i like a more conservative look for work. wouldn't want form-fitting and short dress. my favorite kind of dress is form-fitting and falls at or below my knees a little.,2
Very pretty top! the fabric is super soft. i ended up sizing up from my regular xs to a s because the chest area was just a bit snug.,2
Beautiful  unique  colors perfect for winter. i received so many compliments at two holiday parties. and on sale  this is a no-brainer,2
This dress is good quality but the designers today really need to design their clothing line with the busty woman in mind.,2
I was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail. great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric. very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful. could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric. fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model.,2
High quality  and worth full price.... but way too small. also a bit short in the torso.,1
This sweater would have been a better fit for me if the sleeves were slightly larger and had a button/snap on the front. the material is soft and comfortable. black pairs well with jeans.,2
This dress fits true to size- i ordered an 8 and it fits like a glove. it is a bit shorter than i thought (i'm 5'8'') but will be perfect with leggings in the winter and for the weekend in spring. it is a nice weight linen  not too thin. the dots aren't white  they're more light blue. very cute dress!,2
I really try to avoid hand washing so i immediately checked the label when i found this dress in-store. and despite the fact that retailer lists this as hand wash online  the label says machine wash. (it also says lay flat to dry.) so i was happy about that. i tried this in xs regular (first photo with camisole) which was too low-cut and then ordered the xspetite in the second photo (i'm a 34aa  ~105 lbs.) which was better; higher v-neck mainly and shorter length  although i could've gone with eit,2
Beautiful dress. the color in person in a rich golden sun  not too flashy. a very warm hue  it will compliment every skin tone. it is more fitted than most peasant dresses. not as much flowing material  very flattering. the slight beading on the yoke makes it a standout. very well made  with a nice cotton lining. i am usually a size six in a dress  and the small fit beautifully  even with my large top. it is a stunner  that can be worn with boots or sandals. you will receive a lot of compliments,2
It is a little boxy  but it?s not unflattering in my opinion. the sweatshirt material is soft  the ruffles keep their shape and position  and aren?t too overwhelming on my small frame. i like the small slits on the sides  they allow the sweater to drape nicely. it also hit at a flattering spot  a little below the hip. 5?1??  100 lbs  and got the xxs petite. this fit true to size for me.,2
Got this dress for a party.  it was a last minute purchase and i was nervous if it would fit.  it not only fit  it looks great and is very comfortable.  have to love an a-line skirt and a top with short sleeves.  it covers everything while looking sexy.  and i didn't have to spend a second worrying if something was showing that shouldn't be.  got compliments all night.  i got it in red and black but went with the red based on feedback from husband and bff.  buy it now.  its perfect for holiday p,2
I think this dress is beautiful. i ordered it for my brother's wedding  but the nude slip underneath made the dress look a bit too revealing. i may keep it for a holiday party though because it really is gorgeous and super flattering. it dies run large. typically i'm a 10 and the 8 fit perfectly.,2
Was so thrilled to receive my dress in the mail. its just what i was looking for  for my staple summer dress. i love how i can wear it with or without the sweater top  and even can pair just the sweater top with my high-waisted shorts!,2
I love this tee  i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal.,2
I've been looking for a cozy sweater dress for a while because everything always seems to be so form fitting. i'm between an xs and a small and i got the small for this and it's just a little roomy so it's perfect. fabric is pretty thin so it drapes well and it won't be too warm.,2
This top reminds me of something out of the 40's. it is super comfortable and just makes a very clean look,2
These are absolutely fabulous!!! love them! comfortable great fabric! best buy of the year so far!,2
I bought this today in a size 2. fits perfect. i am normally a 0 or 2 or xs. the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested. because it is not long in the front. i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front. it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing. it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape. it is on the shorter side. very nice material and design as well as details. overall good pick.,2
I love wide-leg pants and i'm so glad they're back. i bought this pair in the navy and cream colors as soon as i saw them online. i bought my usual size 28 in retailer and they fit just fine. the navy color is more like a dark blue but still perfect for spring/summer. comfortable material and overall good quality. i just wish they came in more colors.,2
This top is great for those days when you have nothing to wear. just throw this on and get ready for the compliments!,2
I bought this shirt in every color. i look sexy and the best part is how comfortable it is. it is very versatile. i wear it at networking semi formal events/ dinners/ going out with friends  and everywhere. i feel awesome with it.,2
This.  an unexpected purchase...i found this on my way to the dressing room.  the fit is stunning. i sized way down (i.e. normally wear 10/12  curvy  and bought a small).  it accentuates my curves  and is incredibly flattering. i bought the navy  and will be adding another color soon!  the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy. it's a nice addition to my work wardrobe.,2
I love this jacket. runs true to size. plan on wearing this a lot this spring and summer. perfect for our weather here. looks just like a jacket but has the stretch and give of a sweater and not heavy like other pea coats. can be dressed up or casual.,2
I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing. the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online. once i pulled it out of the bag  my first thought was how could retailer send me a used  washed and shrunken sweater. it is nothing like the picture. it fits like a midriff top  not exaggerating. i'm 5.6  ordered the m  don't waste your shipping money on this.,0
"For the last two years  i have only purchased clothing for myself if it is secondhand  but then i saw this skirt and succumbed to temptation. first of all  the print is gorgeous! i'm a sucker for blue and white anything so it wasn't that hard of a sell. as other reviewers have mentioned  the seams line up! this kind of quality is so hard to find in clothing items anymore and really makes the skirt seem much more pricey than it really is (if you're buying it on sale like i did). i'm 5'3"" and will",2
I caught a sneak peak of this beautiful dress on a local retailer instagram page...and i was so excited when it arrived at my store. i love this dress! i went with the black because i loved how bold it was. it's ultra feminine and flowy. the slip underneath has the prettiest embroidered print and the overlay is light and airy. the bottom is hemmed with a little lace peekaboo and it is wonderful. i tried this on in both a l and an xl. the xl fit well but the dress was a little long on top  so i wen,2
"Thought this would be my goto fall ""dressy sweathsirt."" it ran smaller than expected and it just didn't have the drapey sweatshirt shape that i prefer. the detailing on the arms and waistband is to die for though.....",2
Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on  much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.  i returned it same day i received it  which was disappointing.,0
This dress is my first retailer purchase in several years. i saw it in the window and had to try it on! i'm quite small  usually a size 0  2 at most  and 34b at the top. i had to size up to a 4 in this dress for it to zip up and be moderately comfortable.    i love the 50s vibe of the volume at the bottom. the cotton is nice - glad to see retailer go back to offering natural fabrics!    very pretty color  and print.,2
I loved this dress immediately. it is soft to the touch and super comfortable. i will be wearing this so much this summer! the arms are true to size and the body is flowy and roomy  but it is still flattering! highly recommend!,2
I saw this dress in a store the other day. it is so cute in real life. i don't think the pictures online even begin to show how cute it is on. the dress is well-made and it fit perfectly. in fact  it is quite flattering. i am so happy i saw it in the store. even though i am big online shopper i would have passed on this dress if i only saw it online  but don't because it is worth every penny.,2
Like other ladies have mentioned  this dress runs small in the chest and waist region. you must size up!  __________  pros:  - flattering fit and flow. hides lumps and bumps.  - cut at the neck and back is cute and didn't make me look chunky surprisingly.  - little red polka dots aren't overwhelmingly at all and add a nice retro feel.  - good overall length.  - usa made!  __________  cons:  - runs small in the chest and waist. i'm a 36c  hourglass  170 lbs and normally can wear a size 10 in tops,2
This romper originally caught my eye in the beginning of the summer with the sweet back bow detail. i had originally planned to purchase for a trip to paris in june  but waited until the last minute and my size wasn't immediately available at my local store. i had honestly forgotten about the romper until i noticed it recently in the sale section ... at that price i couldn't pass it up. again it wasn't available in my size at the store location  but they were able to ship it w/in a few days. i p,2
I saw this on sale  and it looked lovely online. i really wanted to love it when i received it. it looked great  but once i tried it on  it bunches up in the back. it looks awkward. the lace and small details are pretty  but the fit is just off. returned it in the store.,0
I ordered the blue version in size xl. it looked just like the photos online. it fit true to size. the problem for me was the weight of the sweater. it was too bulky & uncomfortable to wear. the color of blue was nice. the knit wasn't very soft but wasn't scratchy either. i found a better choice from retailer so i returned this.,0
"I really like this top.  for reference  i am usually an xs or s in retailer tops since many of them run large  however  in this top i ordered a size m and it fit nicely.  in any brand other than retailer  my usual size is m as i am 36d bust  132 lbs.  5""5.",2
"I am about 5'6""  135 lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium. i ordered a small  as another reviewer did. right when i took it out of the packaging  i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo. i knew the sweater was going to be cropped  but it falls right at the top of my hip bones. when i raise my arms up  my whole midriff shows. did not flatter my athletic build at all. the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine  skimming but not tight",1
Very cute and comfortable!does run big  i used the size chart and it's very generous-would order down a size next time.,2
I had it on my wish list for a long time  not sure whether i should purchase  i even hesitated when it went on sale  but boy  am i glad i did order it... it is crazy comfortable  flattering  and love that it looks black but is blue... i ordered both xs and xs p and decided to go with the petite as it will look super cute in the fall with boots. not too short (i am 5 foot 1.5)... the fake leather part concerned me at first  but i like it now... nothing bad ot say about it!,2
This sweater is absolutely gorgeous. the design and structure might make your shoulders look a little bigger  but i absolutely love it. it has a little boxy shape but i feel like it goes with te style. love it! get tons of compliments every time i wear it.,2
Dress is pretty  i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer. i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings. nice but not nice enough to keep  i am returning. :(,1
Tts and very very sleek and flattering. just love for summer. nice light weight. feel great on and not saggy. nice color addition since my other favorite are lighter shade of blue.,2
Contrary to the first review  there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on  it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted  and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l,0
"It is a beautiful dress  light and delicate. i got my usual xsmall ( 5'4"" 34c  134 lbs). it comes with a slip and the slip is a bit fitted. it worked for me  but i can see this being an issue. it can easily be resolved with any other ivory or nude slip. it is worth it. very cute dress.",2
"I debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model  but if i was to tighten it  it looks a lot more flattering... i tried on the xs in the store (i usually do that to decide if i need petite)  and it looked huge  when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work  it was a lot of fabric  and looser didn't look as good on me... but i like the dress overall  so still recommend. and for those who like the looser look  this is great. i would  however  order eptite for 5'1.5"". (115 lbs  03 dd che",2
Nice  thick material. cream has lining underneath which i appreciated so that it's not sheer in the light.  flattering design,2
"5 7""   138 pound   73 year old grandmother. can't wear wool and always looking for stylish cotton/linen sweaters.  ordered m based on reviews. very tight across back and sleeves too short. loved the style  the below hip length  and color so reordered in a large. still waiting for sweater. hoping it fits better",2
I just got this and couldn't wait to wear it to work today. it is such a pretty designed top. unfortunately  it is falling apart as i write this review. one sleeve is unraveling. there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms. am so disappointed in the quality. i'll be sending it back when i get home.,0
I think the description and image might be slightly misleading and is giving this dress a bad name...it's not a drop waist dress as indicated in the description. it's a swingy a line silhouette- more fitted in the bodice and swingy as it its bells at the hem- which i find flattering. another discrepancy is that the brand is hd in paris  not glamorous. however i happened to find an online return at my local store and liked the print so i tried it on and fell in love with the 60s retro vibe and pr,2
Love the muted pattern in the blue and spots of gray  front and back. i wore this with my gray legging/pants. the pleats allow for a relaxed fit; very comfortable over all.,2
This dress is so versatile. great summer wear!,2
I bought this top for work but i can also wear it out with friends. it is made well and has a lining that is comfortable and makes it flow nicely. it will be nice for summer. you can tie the neck or just leave the ties down so it has options.,2
Usually retailer's designs run small for me  but this large fits great. super comfortable  long enough to wear with leggings. love the back cutout design and fabric choice. depending on bust size  it may seem to sit funny  but it's not meant to be a true baby doll design that sits under the bust. mine looks great :-),2
This jumpsuit is great! i finally found a jumpsuit that works with my longer torso. the fabric is so comfortable and moves with you. i'm planning to pair a thick belt with the jumpsuit over the portion with the tie  just for some added detail while wearing the piece. it's quite easy to get in and out of.,2
This dress is beautiful on! it is flowy and loose but is cut well so it avoids looking like a tent. white dresses with lace can run the risk of being a bit fussy-- the lace at the bottom is a beautiful detail without being too precious and the handkerchief bottom keeps it interesting. can be styled so many ways-- looks great with a cropped denim jacket  belted  or loose with a long necklace. also tried with a sleeveless long sweater vest and it was adorable. the dress is fully lined and feels su,2
This top does sit weird  feels like a circus outfit... but at the same time its unique in its own way. i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down  probably because of the way this top is styled. i'm 6ft tall 160 lbs i have curvy body and small chest 34a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway. material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton.,2
The fabric is lovely  color was great  but unfortunately it ran a bit large. this might be a case of girls with boobs vs. girls without. i have a small chest so for me  this just didn't stay in place. i was worried about the arms squeezing me so i got a small rather than my usual xs. bad choice. the diamond in the middle pooches out rather than hugging your body (which was what i was hoping for). when i raise my arms the whole shirt ends up riding up. pretty awkward. there's also a lot of fabric,1
In the photo  this sweater is very appealing but in person very disappointing. i am 5'7  always take a size medium but on me  the sleeves were far too long and the sweater just didn't fit properly. the collar doesn't fold right in the front and it hangs awkwardly. if you try to use the button  it stretches and looks terrible. in the back  it falls short. it's going back.,0
I bought these in both colors. i'm usually an xs or a small and i went with the small for the length. they are a comfy shirt great for the hot summer days.,2
I liked the color of this top but i didn't really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.,2
"I am 5' 7"" - 110 lbs. ordered my normal xs and the bottom portion was way over sized. it fit like a parachute  you could fit about 12 of me in the bottoms and very short. nice quality material  but extremely awkward fit.",1
Cute socks  very comfy as well. good quality in person.,2
"These photos do not do the vest any justice. i randomly saw this in the sale section at my local retailer. tried it on and it was super cute  but i did the whole ""walk away  maybe you'll forget about it"" thing. that did not happen. i ran back to retailer on my lunch break the next day  and thank goodness  there was still one left in my size. it actually drapes in a flattering way  and it looks polished. it's so versatile. i would not have looked for this vest based on these photos  but i'm telling y",2
I ordered the orange color too. these are perfect for throwing on over workout clothes and then running errands.,2
"I love this sweater dress! i was hesitant to order it after reading some of the reviews  but fear not  friends--this is a comfortable  flattering  warm dress with a unique twist. i love the cowl and the buttons down the back. the knit is fairly large so there's some give to it  which means pulling it on is a breeze  and the buttons don't slip out of their closures unexpectedly  which is an added bonus. i ordered both grey and navy. i stand at 5'6"" and would describe myself as pear-shaped  typica",2
This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this,2
I loved the delicate and feminine print of this blouse at first sight. the fit was perfect - just enough room to be flattering and comfortable  without adding any unnecessary bulk. the style and print could even be paired with a more classic skirt and pumps and go to the office. the length was also spot-on - it's not too long to be a tunic  yet long enough to wear with skinny jeans or even leggings on an errand-running day. the blouse is very lightweight and sheer  making it that much more comfo,2
"This was the first suit i've ever ordered online and the first one piece i've tried since i was a very young girl  so i was a little skeptical going into this. i'm 5'9""  ~145 lbs  34b  with a pear shape and short torso. i was pleasantly surprised by the overall fit--the length was right  the bottoms fit really well (i was nervous about the boy short/hip hugger design)  and the suit was just very comfortable and cute. however  something about the cups just didn't work with my chest; my breasts di",2
Love these! they are my new favorite weekend pant. they are comfortable  versatile  and cute. the fit and cut are great too. a must have for your wardrobe.,2
I ordered the black and white version online  and the dress fit perfectly. it was very well-made with a nicely textured  heavier cloth  and the overall appearance is very classy. it is a versatile dress  and i would highly recommend it!,2
Love it - material is soft and color goes will with any color.,2
"I got so many compliments from friends  i bought another one in different print. packs and travels well. i'm 5'6"" and a heathy 160 lbs  carry my weight in the middle. this dress is very flattering and fabric feels like pj's. also east to wear with regular undies and racer back bra. living in a warm humid climate  it's my new go to dress. the fabric is so stretchy that i found the medium a better fit instead of my usual large.",2
Good design  comfortable fit. however  sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits with minimal support. agree with the previous review. not sure it is a keeper.,1
"Cute top  perfect by itself or for layering. i sensed it would run large  so i ordered an xxs  115 lbs  5'2"".",2
I love this top! i typically wear a size small and this is very true to size. it's loose fitting but does not make you look large. the pattern on the material is also fun without being too busy. perfect for fall!,2
Living in alaska means fall starts early and winter runs long. this great little skirt is perfect for casual fridays and weekends. i am 4'11 and ordered the petite 4  which is a little big around the waist  but could tuck a sweater or shirt in. absolutely love this skirt and thinking about purchasing in another color.,2
"What a great little find. it is so soft  and the color blends with everything. a great way to get a few more weeks out of your summer sleeveless dresses  and ease into fall. great with t shirts and pants as well.the collar is flattering over any neckline. it also looks great as a shirt. it really can be worn all year round. i usually wear a size six on top  as ""my girls"" are large. the medium was a perfect fit. and there was no billowing in the back. worth the price  as it will become a go to ja",2
I absolutely love this sweater. it will take me into spring and right on in to summer beach bonfire nights. a great staple!,2
This is my favorite dress i've bought in the past year! it is super flattering and can be worn for work or casual wear. the fabric is soft and comfortable. can't wait till the weather gets warmer so i can start wearing it regularly!  i'm 5'5 145lbs  37-29-39. i got the medium petite and it fits perfectly!,2
"First off  i adore this jumpsuit.  i love the mixed stripes and i love that the fabric is structured  textured and substantial.  and for me  the xs fits perfectly  however the sizing is way off from standard sizing. i'm 5'2""  110  24.5 waist  32.5 hips  and usually 00p-0p  and this is fitted on me.  the wide legs aren't too wide like most wide legs (which wear me instead of vice versa) and the structure of the fabric make this piece so flattering for petite ladies.  if you are petite  this jumps",2
I was drawn to this sweater for its vibrant colours and unique pattern. i tried it on and immediately fell in love with the comfort  quality  and design. it is a little short  but this minor issue is easily fixed with by wearing a neutral colored undershirt/camisole. the cuffed sleeves reveal a matching pattern and can be rolled down or up. i usually wear a xs or s in retailer's clothes  but i sized up to a m on this one. definitely worth it. this is a festive winter piece that can be dressed up o,2
I bought a size s in the navy  and m in the neutral  and both fit. i usually wear a small  but they only had the size m left in the neutral. the m is a little big  but the extra room fits the flowy  bohemian style of the blouse  so it works. i love this top and am glad i purchased it in both colors. definitely recommend it.,2
I tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress. there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress.,0
Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.,1
"This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however  is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3"" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the",0
I ordered the red in xs petite  xxs and xxs petite (in case petite was too short). so far  the xs petite and xxs petite were shipped to me  however  thought the bag said petite  the actual dresses inside were regular sizes  and they were huge  even the xxs (i put it on on top of another knit dress and it was big0. so i reordered  this time only the xxs petite (though i am technically waiting for the xxs regular)... perhaps all the bags have been switched... we shall see  but perhaps this isn't t,1
This is now one of my favorite items in my wardrobe!! it is comfortable yet can be dressed up or down to fit any occasion.,2
I ordered this in an xs  which is my normal size in retailer tops. the stitching and detail on the straps is beautiful  but they were also somewhat tight across my bust and across my back. it puckered in a strange way that wasn't flattering. back it goes  unfortunately.,1
Very unique  cute top. i had to order up a size as i thought it ran a little on the small size.,2
I absolutely love this skirt! i feel like the color works well for most seasons: you can pair it with a light tee or tank top and some sandals during warmer months  or layer it with a sweater  thick tights and boots in autumn. really nice staple piece for your wardrobe. i do think it runs a bit large: i generally wear a 6 (depending on the brand and style)  but this 6 was way too large around my waist by at least a couple inches. i returned it and got a 4  which fit me perfectly. it's nice that,2
I love this dress! it is perfect for a wedding  brunch with friends  or even work. it is beautifully made and is comfortable. i have it in the yellow colorway  but i am tempted to go back and purchase it in the purple colorway as well.,2
"This dress is really lovely and the quality seems excellent. the bodice of the dress fits tight and that is why i knocked off one star. i am a 34 a 5'6"" and 123 lbs.  ordered the 2  my usual size. the top part is very snug and it hugs tightly around my neck which i don't like. i may try going up a size but it fits so perfectly everywhere else. the length is perfect it just touches the ground  no need to hem it even with flats. the color may be a bit more of a peachy color in person but overall t",2
Fits perfectly! i don't think this is too long and i'm a shorty. great style -- wish it came in more colors - i would definitely buy again!,2
I really liked this dress. it's so comfy  i could sleep in it plus it's quite flattering. however  if you have a tummy  which i do  you have to really suck it in. the dress will show bulges but the layers make it a little more forgiving that the typical fitted dress. the length is great and conservative enough that i wore it to work today  though it does ride up as you walk. the blue is dark enough it could almost be worn with black shoes  almost. the top is really cut well with the perfect neck,2
I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice  the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price...,1
It really is a beautiful sweater.  the material is super soft and feels luxurious.  unfortunately  it just looked too bulky on me and accentuated my width.  maybe if i were taller  i could pull it off.,1
This tee is versatile  soft  well made  and it washes/dries well. i love longer length and stripe pocket details. it runs true to size  and it is a beautiful dark navy blue. what more can i ask for?,2
Surprised that this is a fall/winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful but the material isn't that thick and the tie at the waist is unusual. would have been better if rather than having the tie built into the dress it was separate.,2
I was a little skeptical to buy this dress at first because of the pattern. in all honestly  i am so happy that i did. it's so unique and truly a one of a kind design. when tried on the dress is very slimming.,2
I new i had to have this dress the moment i saw it. i am a recent convert to byron lars and have three dress of his design. they are all 6 or 6p so i felt confident ordering a 6. whoops! this dress fit perfectly up to the waist. it was even a little roomy but i couldn't button it up any further than that. it is a little weird since i always thought i had a narrow ribcage. anyway  i will have to exchange it for an 8p. and hope for the best. it really is an exquisitely beautiful dress and unbeliev,2
This dress is perfect! i just bought it yesterday in store for a wedding i'm going to next spring. i got it in red  which is normally not a great color for me  but it's a darker red so it works. i love anything with cutouts so i was drawn to it immediately. i normally wear a 10 in a dress to accommodate my (rather wide) shoulders  and the 10 fit well. i can see it working for a variety of occasions. one big plus is the quality--this isn't even remotely flimsy.,2
I tried this one and actually liked it more on me when the shoulders were slightly covered  so i decided to leave it back as it would bug me eventually... but the style is very feminine and the colors are gorgeous... if you like off the shoulder look  i say definitely worth it. the fabric was soft enough too.    the xs (or 0) was great (regular size) for 115 lbs  30 dd.,2
These pants look great on and i love the ponte fabric on the back of the pants.  i usually wear a 28 in pilcro but i went with a 29 for these.  great length and my only criticism would be the price.  a little expensive for vegan leather.,2
Love this jacket! it is incredibly soft and expensive looking. i love the details with the zippers on the sleeves and very cute lining inside the jacket which is not pictured. i ordered my usual size xxsp and it fit great. this brand does run small so if you are between sizes or prefer a looser fit you should order a size up.,2
I noticed this dress in the highlighted area and then read the reviews. i probably wouldn't have thought much about it just scrolling through the dress pages  and now i'm so glad i bought it. i have worn this dress several times and never fail to get compliments on it. i know i will wear it again come next fall. i am petite  but ordered the regular and find that length to be perfect. i'm a teacher and this dress helps me maintain a classy yet modern look. i purchased the small (usually wear size,2
I love these jeans  but they do stretch out! i was surprised at how loose they were right after washing/air drying the first time.,1
This sweater is big and box. it looks very similar on as it does on the model. as other reviewers have mentioned  the embroidery on the shoulders is a bit itchy.,1
"This is a very beautiful and well-made skirt. it looks a little like ribbon material. it is very think and lush  and the pockets add a little extra special to it. the waist band is very sturdy and it wears very flattering. even putting my hands in the pockets feels very thick and silky. i am 5'1"" with a 27in waist and the size 2 fit really well  just above the knee.",2
This top us flowy  breathable  and feminine. the fabric is light so it doesn't feel like you're wearing a swing dress with heavy fabric. it is sheer so a cami underneath is best. with flowers  less structured tops  i size down to a small or 6. some other tops i'd go to medium or 8.,2
When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it  upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places  the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!,2
I tried on this skirt in stores and loved it. the only thing is  i'm usually a 2 or a 26 and had to buy a 6. for reference  i'm 5' 7 and about 120 pounds. if you want to tuck a light sweater or really anything in  i'd recommend you go up a size as well!,2
Great transition into fall for layering. easy breezy dress up or down-is thin so it does need a cami,2
"I love these pants so much  i have them in two colors. they are super comfy  light and actually really chic. perfect cool girl pants. i have got so many compliments. my young students (4-5) love my ""ninja pants""! i got them on sale. great  great buy. i highly recommend them.",2
"I'd give this dress 6 stars if i could  it's possibly the best dress i've bought at retailer in 12 years of shopping there.  the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage  for anyone with a bit of a tummy. the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly (even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear)  the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch  the fit is true to size  the pattern is bohemian and elegant -- not hippy dippy at all. i'm 5'6""",2
I am wearing this right now! it's a funny fabric--almost like a bedspread--but the cut and fit are perfect. i am short and i love the length of the hem  the babydoll style and the 3/4 sleeve. very cute for summer work or going out.,2
I love this shirt so much that i bought it in both colors. i purchased the xs regular which fit perfectly. the material is incredibly soft yet thick enough that i know it has some durability. the neckline is very flattering and comes up higher than most tees but not so high that it feels constricting. i also love that it is slightly tapered and comes in towards your waist at the sides and is slightly longer in the back. it's an absolute staple in my wardrobe now.,2
I like the design of the dress  but the fabric makes it look cheap. for an expensive dress  i had expected better quality.,1
I just ordered this top and so far really like it  it is pretty and feminine and comfortable. the one thing i would note is that the lace running down the center has holes which you can see through  unlike the lace to each side. it's not extremely noticeable  but i am planning on wearing a cami under it. i ordered a small and it fits pretty well but is definitely on the looser side  i wonder if possibly the extra small would work for me  but i'm fairly tall so i went with the small.,2
Cute but classy top because of the embroidery at the bottom!,1
Very pretty top  but like the other reviewers said?the neck is very itchy. i live in florida and i don't think i can wear this during the summer unless i get the neck lined. i got an xxs p which was a little shorter than i would have liked  so i am returning for xxs.,1
This dress is incredible. i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it! i bought it in the navy color  it's gorgeous in person  very bright  vibrant colors. i am 5'9 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist. i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out  and got it taken in a bit. i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads  if you're thinking about buying this dress  do it  you won't regret it!,2
I&#39;ve been looking for comfortable pants that i could wear to work and at home.  these fit the bill.  i bought these in the holly color for the fall and winter.  they are super soft and very comfortable.  i was worried that they would like dumpy  especially around the seat area  but they fit fine.,2
It is the cutest detailed little white top. i recommend this because you can wear it anywhere and dress it up with a scarf.,2
Great quality and extremely flattering. bonus that it is on sale. i felt like this dress was a godsend. i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy. i think i'll get a lot of mileage out of it  as there's enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then (hopefully!) i can wear it after too. also can be dressed up or down  so appropriate for many occasions. i believe it runs true to size (i sized up  from xs to s  for obvious reasons  but,2
This tee is so soft and comfy. it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual. fits true to size  and not too loose  but not too clingy. i know i'll wear this one a lot!,2
"Great dress! wish it came it more colors  would like to buy another one. i am 5'5"" 125  size small is perfect. unlike one of the previous reviewers  i do not think it is too clingy. maybe she needed to size up.very versital  cute with a jean jacket  or long lightweight scarf  booties  or sandals! .",2
This blouse is romantic and timeless. the tonal print is lovely  the peplum cut flattering. i followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered one size up  which fits perfectly. it has a hidden side zip to make for easier off and on. i love the mix of cotton and silk which makes it breathable and lightweight. thank you  retailer  for finally making a blouse with natural fabrics that do not need a cami underneath! perfect for warm climates.,2
This shirt is so cute! i was unsure about how flowy the sleeves would be- as i'm not one for frills- but the sleeves sit nicely. also  i am between a size small and medium  i got the small and it definitely is flowy. runs big  so if you like a tighter fit you may want to order a size down. i got the red and it's a perfect autumn / winter color. the cut outs are not too showy- so it's not revealing for us gals who are a little more belly-conscious. it's the perfect shirt to just throw on and go a,2
Nice quality  but enough material for two sets of tights. can scrunch up at the bottom for a different look.,2
"This dress is so fun and very comfy! the slip it comes with pulls the whole dress together! it has been great for warm fall days  but i can see it being warn with leggings and boots into the winter. i love the combination of blocked deep colors along side of pastels. i'm 5'5"" and the length is just right  not too short.",2
This top is so lovely. the fabric is thick and soft  and the drape is phenomenal. i did size down based on reviews  i typically wear a large and the medium is perfect  nice and flowy and very flattering.,2
This blouse looks even better in person. it fits true to size and is lightweight. i am not a huge fan of designs on shirts and usually stick with solids but i find this design to be very flattering. i just bought it today but i know i will get a lot of use out of it.,2
Looks great on. i am 5'11 and the length is perfect hits above the knee but not too short. also room in the chest area.,2
Love  love  love these pants! i have yet to remove the tags and wear them  but that shall happen over this weekend. the fit is comfortable  and while the pants are not oversized  they are very generous in the m  that i purchased. the colour that seems to confuse more than is few is really a great combination of a black or navy stripe (depends on your lighting and opinion here...!) with tobacco/khaki on a white ground. the pleats at the top  just add to the great design  and i like that they sit,2
I love these bottoms. great colors. i also love the feel of the bottoms  very soft. high quality.,2
I often find wearing anything described as 'slim' difficult  but these pants are absolutely wonderful. i bought in a size 12 regular length. they are perfect  both in fit and quality.,2
Nice cut but 6 inches too long and no petite sizes available.,1
Saw this hanging in the store. it is cute front and back.  it is flattering as well. i plan to wear under a jacket for work and without a jacket at night.  looks amazing with a denim jacket,2
I wanted to love this  was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful  but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top  and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back  in the back  because it does not lay flat like that in front  it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.,0
Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too.,2
Cute top for jeans or capri pants. love the sleeve length.,2
I found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute  but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style? it fits like a sack  big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem. it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape. genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style. to bad  i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time.,1
I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this dress  based on the previous reviews. for me  it fit perfect. the blouse was fine  not too much fabric. the skirt is soft and stretchy. the fit was tts. for reference  i am 120lbs  34c and i purchased the 4p. it fits great!,2
I tried on the xs in store in crimson (i would need petite) - the color and fit were very flattering on me (pale skin). the dress feels very silky  i love the back  how it ties  and how high the neckline was on me in the front. the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch. my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee... i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go  just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work...     reference: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.,2
The design is so cute (people in different yoga poses  small and subtle prints) and a must for a yogini. i love the colors  it's colorful but not too bright and it's beautiful against the white background. i ordered xs (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips) and it fit perfectly (it has a fitted look but not tight because it has some stretch from the soft cotton material). i like the fact that there's no stretchy spandex feel  just pure soft cotton feel. it's great for gals who are conscious about the arms,2
These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4)  they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug  short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off  these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!,1
This dress is gorgeous. it is somewhat fitted but i didn't find it to run small. i am top heavy 36d and usually wear a size 10  but i bought this in an 8 and it fits me great. i will say the zipper is a bit tricky. at first i thought the dress was too tight but it turned out the zipper was stuck. after fiddling with it  i realized the dress fit but the zipper was a bit tricky. i wore it to work and got so many compliments. also the picture makes the background look burgundy but it is mostly blac,2
I always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints  i think it's a lot of fun. not so fun to put on  but it's worth the trouble. i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself. i also own the mona dress in 8p  but i had to size down to a 6 for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much.,2
I just recently received this dress in the mail. i went up a size to a 10  i am usually a 6 or 8. it fit perfectly. the top is very fitted and the bottom flows nicely. i really like this dress and am looking forward to wearing it to work or out.,2
"This dress embodies the retailer brand. the design is unique  and form fitting for just about any body type. beautiful saturated colors and a great cut make it an all around classic. i wish for more of these designs. i originally ordered my usual size 4  but went down to a 2. this dress runs large. looks great with heels or boots as pictured. i am 5'6"" 134 lb. this dress has a timeless quality that you will wear for years to come. at my age  i try to buy things that i will wear for many sea",2
"This is another ""i've been looking"" for me - a funnel-neck sweatshirt to feign athleticism with. i love it. the material is incredibly soft and warm. the fit is a little snug around a larger bust  and the lines would probably be more flattering on a more... well  modelesque... frame. but i'm thoroughly attached. size up if you're looking for movement.",2
"I absolutely love this. i'm 115  5'6"" and the xs is roomy because of the style  but it drapes very nicely and it's a perfect fit. with my new loafers and cropped pants  i'm all ready for fall! he slightly felted knit is a nice touch. it's also really soft.",2
I bought this jacket in white specifically for summer. it is the perfect weight for the office air conditioning coolness. i wore this jacket with a sleeveless silk blouse and summer skirt. it just looked perfect for a dressier summer outfit. i take a m/l in retailer jackets and went with the large in this because i have a large bust (36d). the medium fit but was just a tad snug through my upper back/front area. the large gave me a little wiggle room so i could wear a little heavier blouse undernea,2
Every spring/summer i look forward to t.la's tanks & tees and stock up on them. sometimes it is difficult to determine the color online  but this top (i bought it in green) is without a doubt the same color in person as it is online. the color is a gorgeous sea green and the softest cotton tee (just keeps getting softer wash after wash) and the silver buttons on the side (what a unique twist to an everyday tee). now all i need is the blue one.,2
Bought these online - sale  and am really happy with them. soft and light material - feel breezy  like a beach pant should!,2
This top is soo pretty with a cool edge.  it looks and feels like really good quality.,2
This will be my go-to shirt for fall! its a great layering piece with just enough detail to make it different than a plain crew neck long sleeve...the neckline is unique & the slit in the back of the shirt adds interest. fit is slim  nicely tailored which makes it perfect for layering. i will likely purchase more colors once on sale! i purchased the dark grey and color is just as expected. my only drawback is how thin the material is - i can see it getting snags or holes easily  but i will deal,2
